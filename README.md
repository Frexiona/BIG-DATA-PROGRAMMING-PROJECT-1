1. parse the text of these files to remove the punctuation; save this new version in a file (the command tr could be useful).
2. list the 20 most frequent words from your text
3. remove the stop words (i.e., the words with little or no real meaning); use a list of stop words from the web (e.g., one of these lists).
4. list the 20 most frequent words excluding stop words

# Performance Testing of the Two Database Systems
We will use the database found here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employees- introduction.html. Itâ€™s a relatively large database (4 millon records, 160MB).
1. download the GitHub repo using the git command git clone https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db
2. modify the employee.sql file to change the name of the database to a the name of a database you can create yourself (remember what Leandro said in the practicals) - use sed for it.
3. Then run mysql < employees.sql
4. check the database.
Now we want to create a similar database in MongoDB. Remember the SQL to Mon- goDB correspondences (more info here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sql- comparison/).
1. write a Bash script that would read the stucture of the MySQL database and create a MongoDB collection for each table in the MySQL server
2. for each of these collections, read the content of the corresponding table in MySQL and populate the MongoDB collection.

Now we want to do some performance comparison of the two database systems.
1. write a simple and a complex (e.g., joint query) queries in SQL and MongoDB. Test them on your databases.
2. write a Bash script that will execute each query and measure the time taken by each query - you can use the following bash variables to measure time:
START_TIME=$SECONDS
dosomething
ELAPSED_TIME=$(($SECONDS - $START_TIME)) echo $ELAPSED_TIME
3. What do you observe?
4. Do you think this was a good way to compare the performance of these two data management systems?
