    Whose misadventurd piteous overthrows
    Doth with their death bury their parents strife
    The fearful passage of their deathmarkd love
    And the continuance of their parents rage
    Which but their childrens end naught could remove
    Is now the two hours traffic of our stage
    The which if you with patient ears attend
    What here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend

  Samp I strike quickly being moved

  Greg But thou art not quickly moved to strike

  Samp A dog of the house of Montague moves me

  Samp A dog of that house shall move me to stand I will take
    the wall of any man or maid of Montagues

  Greg That shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes to the
    wall

  Samp Tis true and therefore women being the weaker vessels
    are ever thrust to the wall Therefore I will push Montagues men
    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall

  Greg The quarrel is between our masters and us their men

  Samp Tis all one I will show myself a tyrant When I have
    fought with the men I will be cruel with the maids I will cut off
    their heads

  Greg The heads of the maids

  Samp Ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads
    Take it in what sense thou wilt

  Greg They must take it in sense that feel it

  Ben Part fools Beats down their swords
    Put up your swords You know not what you do

                          Enter Tybalt


  Tyb What art thou drawn among these heartless hinds
    Turn thee Benvolio look upon thy death

  Ben I do but keep the peace Put up thy sword
    Or manage it to part these men with me

  Tyb What drawn and talk of peace I hate the word
    As I hate hell all Montagues and thee
    Have at thee coward                            They fight

     Enter an officer and three or four Citizens with clubs or
                          partisans


  Officer Clubs bills and partisans Strike beat them down

  Citizens Down with the Capulets Down with the Montagues

           Enter Old Capulet in his gown and his Wife


  Cap What noise is this Give me my long sword ho

  Wife A crutch a crutch Why call you for a sword

  Cap My sword I say Old Montague is come
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me

                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife


  Mon Thou villain Capulet Hold me not let me go

  M Wife Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe

                Enter Prince Escalus with his Train


  Prince Rebellious subjects enemies to peace
    Profaners of this neighbourstained steel
    Will they not hear What ho you men you beasts
    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
    With purple fountains issuing from your veins
    On pain of torture from those bloody hands
    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince
    Three civil brawls bred of an airy word
    By thee old Capulet and Montague
    Have thrice disturbd the quiet of our streets
    And made Veronas ancient citizens
    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
    To wield old partisans in hands as old
    Cankred with peace to part your cankred hate
    If ever you disturb our streets again
    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
    For this time all the rest depart away
    You Capulet shall go along with me
    And Montague come you this afternoon
    To know our farther pleasure in this case
    To old Freetown our common judgment place
    Once more on pain of death all men depart
              Exeunt all but Montague his Wife and Benvolio

  Mon Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
    Speak nephew were you by when it began

  Ben Here were the servants of your adversary
    And yours close fighting ere I did approach
    I drew to part them In the instant came
    The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepard
    Which as he breathd defiance to my ears
    He swung about his head and cut the winds
    Who nothing hurt withal hissd him in scorn
    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
    Came more and more and fought on part and part
    Till the Prince came who parted either part

  M Wife O where is Romeo Saw you him today
    Right glad I am he was not at this fray

  Ben Madam an hour before the worshippd sun
    Peerd forth the golden window of the East
    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
    Where underneath the grove of sycamore
    That westward rooteth from the citys side
    So early walking did I see your son
    Towards him I made but he was ware of me
    And stole into the covert of the wood
    I measuring his affections by my own
    Which then most sought where most might not be found
    Being one too many by my weary self
    Pursud my humour not Pursuing his
    And gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me

  Mon Many a morning hath he there been seen
    With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew
    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
    But all so soon as the allcheering sun
    Should in the furthest East bean to draw
    The shady curtains from Auroras bed
    Away from light steals home my heavy son
    And private in his chamber pens himself
    Shuts up his windows locks fair daylight
    And makes himself an artificial night
    Black and portentous must this humour prove
    Unless good counsel may the cause remove

  Ben My noble uncle do you know the cause

  Mon I neither know it nor can learn of him

  Ben Have you importund him by any means

  Mon Both by myself and many other friend
    But he his own affections counsellor
    Is to himself I will not say how true
    But to himself so secret and so close
    So far from sounding and discovery
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm
    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun
    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
    We would as willingly give cure as know

                       Enter Romeo


  Ben See where he comes So please you step aside
    Ill know his grievance or be much denied

  Mon I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
    To hear true shrift Come madam lets away
                                     Exeunt Montague and Wife

  Ben Good morrow cousin

  Rom Is the day so young

  Ben But new struck nine

  Rom Ay me sad hours seem long
    Was that my father that went hence so fast

  Ben It was What sadness lengthens Romeos hours

  Rom Not having that which having makes them short

  Ben In love

  Rom Out

  Ben Of love

  Rom Out of her favour where I am in love

  Ben Alas that love so gentle in his view
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof

  Rom Alas that love whose view is muffled still
    Should without eyes see pathways to his will
    Where shall we dine O me What fray was here
    Yet tell me not for I have heard it all
    Heres much to do with hate but more with love
    Why then O brawling love O loving hate
    O anything of nothing first create
    O heavy lightness serious vanity
    Misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms
    Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health
    Stillwaking sleep that is not what it is
    This love feel I that feel no love in this
    Dost thou not laugh

  Ben No coz I rather weep

  Rom Good heart at what

  Ben At thy good hearts oppression

  Rom Why such is loves transgression
    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
    Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
    With more of thine This love that thou hast shown
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own
    Love is a smoke raisd with the fume of sighs
    Being purgd a fire sparkling in lovers eyes
    Being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears
    What is it else A madness most discreet
    A choking gall and a preserving sweet
    Farewell my coz

  Ben Soft I will go along
    An if you leave me so you do me wrong

  Rom Tut I have lost myself I am not here
    This is not Romeo hes some other where

  Ben Tell me in sadness who is that you love

  Rom What shall I groan and tell thee

  Ben Groan Why no
    But sadly tell me who

  Rom Bid a sick man in sadness make his will
    Ah word ill urgd to one that is so ill
    In sadness cousin I do love a woman

  Ben I aimd so near when I supposd you lovd

  Rom A right good markman And shes fair I love

  Ben A right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit

  Rom Well in that hit you miss Shell not be hit
    With Cupids arrow She hath Dians wit
    And in strong proof of chastity well armd
    From Loves weak childish bow she lives unharmd
    She will not stay the siege of loving terms
    Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes
    Nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold
    O shes rich in beauty only poor
    That when she dies with beauty dies her store

  Ben Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste

  Rom She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
    For beauty starvd with her severity
    Cuts beauty off from all posterity
    She is too fair too wise wisely too fair
    To merit bliss by making me despair
    She hath forsworn to love and in that vow
    Do I live dead that live to tell it now

  Ben Be ruld by me forget to think of her

  Rom O teach me how I should forget to think

  Ben By giving liberty unto thine eyes
    Examine other beauties

  Rom Tis the way
    To call hers exquisite in question more
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost
    Show me a mistress that is passing fair
    What doth her beauty serve but as a note
    Where I may read who passd that passing fair
    Farewell Thou canst not teach me to forget

  Ben Ill pay that doctrine or else die in debt      Exeunt

    But now my lord what say you to my suit

  Cap But saying oer what I have said before
    My child is yet a stranger in the world
    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years
    Let two more summers wither in their pride
    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride

  Par Younger than she are happy mothers made

  Cap And too soon marrd are those so early made
    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she
    She is the hopeful lady of my earth
    But woo her gentle Paris get her heart
    My will to her consent is but a part
    An she agree within her scope of choice
    Lies my consent and fair according voice

    Whereto I have invited many a guest
    Such as I love and you among the store
    One more most welcome makes my number more
    At my poor house look to behold this night
    Earthtreading stars that make dark heaven light
    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
    When well apparelld April on the heel
    Of limping Winter treads even such delight
    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
    Inherit at my house Hear all all see
    And like her most whose merit most shall be
    Which on more view of many mine being one
    May stand in number though in reckning none
    Come go with me To Servant giving him a paper Go

    Whose names are written there and to them say

  Serv Find them out whose names are written here It is written
    that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor

    here writ and can never find what names the writing person
    hath here writ I must to the learned In good time

                   Enter Benvolio and Romeo


  Ben Tut man one fire burns out anothers burning
    One pain is lessoned by anothers anguish
    Turn giddy and be holp by backward turning
    One desperate grief cures with anothers languish
    Take thou some new infection to thy eye
    And the rank poison of the old will die

  Rom Your plantain leaf is excellent for that

  Ben For what I pray thee

  Rom For your broken shin

  Ben Why Romeo art thou mad

  Rom Not mad but bound more than a madman is
    Shut up in Prison kept without my food
    Whippd and tormented and Godden good fellow

  Serv God gi goden I pray sir can you read

  Serv Perhaps you have learned it without book But I pray can
    you read anything you see

  Rom Ay If I know the letters and the language

  Serv Ye say honestly Rest you merry

  Rom Stay fellow I can read                       He reads

      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters
      The lady widow of Vitruvio
      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces

    rich Capulet and if you be not of the house of Montagues I pray

  Ben At this same ancient feast of Capulets
    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovst
    With all the admired beauties of Verona
    Go thither and with unattainted eye
    Compare her face with some that I shall show
    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow

  Rom When the devout religion of mine eye
    Maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires
    And these who often drownd could never die
    Transparent heretics be burnt for liars
    One fairer than my love The allseeing sun
    Neer saw her match since first the world begun

  Ben Tut you saw her fair none else being by
    Herself poisd with herself in either eye
    But in that crystal scales let there be weighd
    Your ladys love against some other maid
    That I will show you shining at this feast
    And she shall scant show well that now seems best

  Rom Ill go along no such sight to be shown
    But to rejoice in splendour of my own              Exeunt

    My lord and you were then at Mantua
    Nay I do bear a brain But as I said
    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
    Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug

    A bump as big as a young cockrels stone
    A perilous knock and it cried bitterly
    Yea quoth my husband fallst upon thy face

  Jul And stint thou too I pray thee nurse say I

Scene IV
A street

Enter Romeo Mercutio Benvolio with five or six other Maskers
Torchbearers


  Rom What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
    Or shall we on without apology

  Ben The date is out of such prolixity
    Well have no Cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf
    Bearing a Tartars painted bow of lath
    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
    Nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
    After the prompter for our entrance
    But let them measure us by what they will
    Well measure them a measure and be gone

  Rom Give me a torch I am not for this ambling
    Being but heavy I will bear the light

  Mer Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance

  Rom Not I believe me You have dancing shoes
    With nimble soles I have a soul of lead
    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move

  Mer You are a lover Borrow Cupids wings
    And soar with them above a common bound

  Rom I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
    To soar with his light feathers and so bound
    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
    Under loves heavy burthen do I sink

  Mer And to sink in it should you burthen love
    Too great oppression for a tender thing

  Rom Is love a tender thing It is too rough
    Too rude too boistrous and it pricks like thorn

  Mer If love be rough with you be rough with love
    Prick love for pricking and you beat love down
    Give me a case to put my visage in
    A visor for a visor What care I
    What curious eye doth quote deformities
    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me

  Ben Come knock and enter and no sooner in
    But every man betake him to his legs

  Rom A torch for me Let wantons light of heart
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
    For I am proverbd with a grandsire phrase
    Ill be a candleholder and look on
    The game was neer so fair and I am done

  Mer Tut duns the mouse the constables own word
    If thou art Dun well draw thee from the mire
    Of this sirreverence love wherein thou stickst
    Up to the ears Come we burn daylight ho

  Rom Nay thats not so

  Mer I mean sir in delay
    We waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
    Take our good meaning for our judgment sits
    Five times in that ere once in our five wits

  Rom And we mean well in going to this masque
    But tis no wit to go

  Mer Why may one ask

  Rom I dreamt a dream tonight

  Mer And so did I

  Rom Well what was yours

  Mer That dreamers often lie

  Rom In bed asleep while they do dream things true

  Mer O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
    She is the fairies midwife and she comes
    In shape no bigger than an agate stone
    On the forefinger of an alderman
    Drawn with a team of little atomies
    Athwart mens noses as they lie asleep
    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners legs
    The cover of the wings of grasshoppers
    Her traces of the smallest spiders web
    Her collars of the moonshines watry beams
    Her whip of crickets bone the lash of film
    Her wagoner a small greycoated gnat
    Not half so big as a round little worm
    Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid
    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
    Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
    And in this state she gallops night by night
    Through lovers brains and then they dream of love
    Oer courtiers knees that dream on cursies straight
    Oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
    Oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
    Sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose
    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit
    And sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail
    Tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep
    Then dreams he of another benefice
    Sometimes she driveth oer a soldiers neck
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
    Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades
    Of healths five fadom deep and then anon
    Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
    And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
    And sleeps again This is that very Mab
    That plats the manes of horses in the night
    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
    This is the hag when maids lie on their backs
    That presses them and learns them first to bear
    Making them women of good carriage
    This is she

  Rom Peace peace Mercutio peace
    Thou talkst of nothing

  Mer True I talk of dreams
    Which are the children of an idle brain
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy
    Which is as thin of substance as the air
    And more inconstant than the wind who wooes
    Even now the frozen bosom of the North
    And being angerd puffs away from thence
    Turning his face to the dewdropping South

  Ben This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
    Supper is done and we shall come too late

  Rom I fear too early for my mind misgives
    Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
    With this nights revels and expire the term
    Of a despised life closd in my breast
    By some vile forfeit of untimely death
    But he that hath the steerage of my course
    Direct my sail On lusty gentlemen

  Ben Strike drum
                           They march about the stage Exeunt

    hand Of yonder knight

  Serv I know not sir

  Rom O she doth teach the torches to burn bright
    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiops ear
    Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
    As yonder lady oer her fellows shows
    The measure done Ill watch her place of stand
    And touching hers make blessed my rude hand
    Did my heart love till now Forswear it sight
    For I neer saw true beauty till this night

  Tyb This by his voice should be a Montague
    Fetch me my rapier boy What dares the slave

PROLOGUE

Enter Chorus


  Chor Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
    And young affection gapes to be his heir
    That fair for which love groand for and would die
    With tender Juliet matchd is now not fair
    Now Romeo is belovd and loves again
    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks
    But to his foe supposd he must complain
    And she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks
    Being held a foe he may not have access
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
    And she as much in love her means much less
    To meet her new beloved anywhere
    But passion lends them power time means to meet
    Tempring extremities with extreme sweet

A lane by the wall of Capulets orchard

Enter Romeo alone


  Rom Can I go forward when my heart is here
    Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
                     Climbs the wall and leaps down within it

                   Enter Benvolio with Mercutio


  Ben Romeo my cousin Romeo Romeo

  Mer He is wise
    And on my life hath stoln him home to bed

  Ben He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall
    Call good Mercutio

  Mer Nay Ill conjure too
    Romeo humours madman passion lover
    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
    Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied
    Cry but Ay me pronounce but love and dove
    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word
    One nickname for her purblind son and heir
    Young Adam Cupid he that shot so trim
    When King Cophetua lovd the beggar maid
    He heareth not he stirreth not be moveth not
    The ape is dead and I must conjure him
    I conjure thee by Rosalines bright eyes
    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip
    By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie
    That in thy likeness thou appear to us

  Ben An if he hear thee thou wilt anger him

  Mer This cannot anger him Twould anger him
    To raise a spirit in his mistress circle
    Of some strange nature letting it there stand
    Till she had laid it and conjurd it down
    That were some spite my invocation
    Is fair and honest in his mistress name
    I conjure only but to raise up him

  Ben Come he hath hid himself among these trees
    To be consorted with the humorous night
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark

  Mer If love be blind love cannot hit the mark
    Now will he sit under a medlar tree
    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone
    O Romeo that she were O that she were
    An open et cetera thou a poprin pear
    Romeo good night Ill to my trucklebed
    This fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep
    Come shall we go

  Ben Go then for tis in vain
    To seek him here that means not to be found
                                                         Exeunt




Scene II
Capulets orchard

Enter Romeo


  Rom He jests at scars that never felt a wound

                     Enter Juliet above at a window

    But soft What light through yonder window breaks
    It is the East and Juliet is the sun
    Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
    Who is already sick and pale with grief
    That thou her maid art far more fair than she
    Be not her maid since she is envious
    Her vestal livery is but sick and green
    And none but fools do wear it Cast it off
    It is my lady O it is my love
    O that she knew she were
    She speaks yet she says nothing What of that
    Her eye discourses I will answer it
    I am too bold tis not to me she speaks
    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
    Having some business do entreat her eyes
    To twinkle in their spheres till they return
    What if her eyes were there they in her head
    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
    As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
    Would through the airy region stream so bright
    That birds would sing and think it were not night
    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
    O that I were a glove upon that hand
    That I might touch that cheek

  Jul Ay me

  Rom She speaks
    O speak again bright angel for thou art
    As glorious to this night being oer my head
    As is a winged messenger of heaven
    Unto the whiteupturned wondring eyes
    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    When he bestrides the lazypacing clouds
    And sails upon the bosom of the air

  Jul O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name
    Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
    And Ill no longer be a Capulet

  Rom aside Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this

  Jul Tis but thy name that is my enemy
    Thou art thyself though not a Montague
    Whats Montague it is nor hand nor foot
    Nor arm nor face nor any other part
    Belonging to a man O be some other name
    Whats in a name That which we call a rose
    By any other name would smell as sweet
    So Romeo would were he not Romeo calld
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    Without that title Romeo doff thy name
    And for that name which is no part of thee
    Take all myself

  Rom I take thee at thy word
    Call me but love and Ill be new baptizd
    Henceforth I never will be Romeo

  Jul What man art thou that thus bescreend in night
    So stumblest on my counsel

  Rom By a name
    I know not how to tell thee who I am
    My name dear saint is hateful to myself
    Because it is an enemy to thee
    Had I it written I would tear the word

  Jul My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
    Of that tongues utterance yet I know the sound
    Art thou not Romeo and a Montague

  Rom Neither fair saint if either thee dislike

  Jul How camst thou hither tell me and wherefore
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb
    And the place death considering who thou art
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here

  Rom With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls
    For stony limits cannot hold love out
    And what love can do that dares love attempt
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me

  Jul If they do see thee they will murther thee

  Rom Alack there lies more peril in thine eye
    Than twenty of their swords Look thou but sweet
    And I am proof against their enmity

  Jul I would not for the world they saw thee here

  Rom I have nights cloak to hide me from their sight
    And but thou love me let them find me here
    My life were better ended by their hate
    Than death prorogued wanting of thy love

  Jul By whose direction foundst thou out this place

  Rom By love that first did prompt me to enquire
    He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes
    I am no pilot yet wert thou as far
    As that vast shore washd with the farthest sea
    I would adventure for such merchandise

  Jul Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
    Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny
    What I have spoke but farewell compliment
    Dost thou love me I know thou wilt say Ay
    And I will take thy word Yet if thou swearst
    Thou mayst prove false At lovers perjuries
    They say Jove laughs O gentle Romeo
    If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won
    Ill frown and be perverse and say thee nay
    So thou wilt woo but else not for the world
    In truth fair Montague I am too fond
    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light
    But trust me gentleman Ill prove more true
    Than those that have more cunning to be strange
    I should have been more strange I must confess
    But that thou overheardst ere I was ware
    My truelove passion Therefore pardon me
    And not impute this yielding to light love
    Which the dark night hath so discovered

  Rom Lady by yonder blessed moon I swear
    That tips with silver all these fruittree tops

  Jul O swear not by the moon th inconstant moon
    That monthly changes in her circled orb
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable

  Rom What shall I swear by

  Jul Do not swear at all
    Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
    Which is the god of my idolatry
    And Ill believe thee

  Rom If my hearts dear love

  Jul Well do not swear Although I joy in thee
    I have no joy of this contract tonight
    It is too rash too unadvisd too sudden
    Too like the lightning which doth cease to be
    Ere one can say It lightens Sweet good night
    This bud of love by summers ripening breath
    May prove a beauteous flowr when next we meet
    Good night good night As sweet repose and rest
    Come to thy heart as that within my breast

  Rom O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied

  Jul What satisfaction canst thou have tonight

  Rom Th exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine

  Jul I gave thee mine before thou didst request it
    And yet I would it were to give again

  Rom Wouldst thou withdraw it For what purpose love

  Jul But to be frank and give it thee again
    And yet I wish but for the thing I have
    My bounty is as boundless as the sea
    My love as deep the more I give to thee
    The more I have for both are infinite
    I hear some noise within Dear love adieu
                                           Nurse calls within
    Anon good nurse Sweet Montague be true
    Stay but a little I will come again                Exit

  Rom O blessed blessed night I am afeard
    Being in night all this is but a dream
    Too flatteringsweet to be substantial

  Rom A thousand times the worse to want thy light

    But love from love towards school with heavy looks

                     Enter Juliet again above


  Jul Hist Romeo hist O for a falconers voice
    To lure this tasselgentle back again
    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
    With repetition of my Romeos name
    Romeo

  Rom It is my soul that calls upon my name
    How silversweet sound lovers tongues by night
    Like softest music to attending ears

  Jul Romeo

  Rom By the hour of nine

  Jul I will not fail Tis twenty years till then
    I have forgot why I did call thee back

  Rom Let me stand here till thou remember it

  Jul I shall forget to have thee still stand there
    Remembring how I love thy company

  Rom And Ill still stay to have thee still forget
    Forgetting any other home but this

  Jul Tis almost morning I would have thee gone
    And yet no farther than a wantons bird
    That lets it hop a little from her hand
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again
    So lovingjealous of his liberty

  Rom I would I were thy bird

  Jul Sweet so would I
    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing
    Good night good night Parting is such sweet sorrow
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow
                                                         Exit

  Rom Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
    Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
    Hence will I to my ghostly fathers cell
    His help to crave and my dear hap to tell
 Exit




Scene III
Friar Laurences cell

Enter Friar Laurence alone with a basket


  Friar The greyeyd morn smiles on the frowning night
    Checkring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light
    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    From forth days path and Titans fiery wheels
    Non ere the sun advance his burning eye
    The day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry
    I must upfill this osier cage of ours
    With baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
    The earth thats natures mother is her tomb
    What is her burying gave that is her womb
    And from her womb children of divers kind
    We sucking on her natural bosom find
    Many for many virtues excellent
    None but for some and yet all different
    O mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    In plants herbs stones and their true qualities
    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
    But to the earth some special good doth give
    Nor aught so good but straind from that fair use
    Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
    Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
    And vice sometimes by action dignified
    Within the infant rind of this small flower
    Poison hath residence and medicine power
    For this being smelt with that part cheers each part
    Being tasted slays all senses with the heart
    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
    In man as well as herbs grace and rude will
    And where the worser is predominant
    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant

                        Enter Romeo


  Rom Good morrow father

  Friar Benedicite
    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me
    Young son it argues a distempered head
    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
    Care keeps his watch in every old mans eye
    And where care lodges sleep will never lie
    But where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain
    Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
    Thou art uprousd with some distemprature
    Or if not so then here I hit it right
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight

  Rom That last is truethe sweeter rest was mine

  Friar God pardon sin Wast thou with Rosaline

  Rom With Rosaline my ghostly father No
    I have forgot that name and that names woe

  Friar Thats my good son But where hast thou been then

  Rom Ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again
    I have been feasting with mine enemy
    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
    Thats by me wounded Both our remedies
    Within thy help and holy physic lies
    I bear no hatred blessed man for lo
    My intercession likewise steads my foe

  Friar Be plain good son and homely in thy drift
    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift

  Rom Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set
    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet
    As mine on hers so hers is set on mine
    And all combind save what thou must combine
    By holy marriage When and where and how
    We met we wood and made exchange of vow
    Ill tell thee as we pass but this I pray
    That thou consent to marry us today

  Friar Holy Saint Francis What a change is here
    Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear
    So soon forsaken Young mens love then lies
    Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
    Jesu Maria What a deal of brine
    Hath washd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline
    How much salt water thrown away in waste
    To season love that of it doth not taste
    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears
    Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    Of an old tear that is not washd off yet
    If eer thou wast thyself and these woes thine
    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline
    And art thou changd Pronounce this sentence then
    Women may fall when theres no strength in men

  Rom Thou chidst me oft for loving Rosaline

  Friar For doting not for loving pupil mine

  Rom And badst me bury love

  Friar Not in a grave
    To lay one in another out to have

  Rom I pray thee chide not She whom I love now
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow
    The other did not so

  Friar O she knew well
    Thy love did read by rote that could not spell
    But come young waverer come go with me
    In one respect Ill thy assistant be
    For this alliance may so happy prove
    To turn your households rancour to pure love

  Rom O let us hence I stand on sudden haste

  Friar Wisely and slow They stumble that run fast
                                                         Exeunt

    butcher of a silk button a duellist a duellist a gentleman

  Mer The pox of such antic lisping affecting fantasticoes

    tall man a very good whore Why is not this a lamentable thing
    grandsir that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
    flies these fashionmongers these pardonamis who stand
    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
    bench O their bones their bones

                               Enter Romeo


  Ben Here comes Romeo here comes Romeo

  Mer Without his roe like a dried herring O flesh flesh how
    art thou fishified Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
    flowed in Laura to his lady was but a kitchen wench marry she
    had a better love to berhyme her Dido a dowdy Cleopatra a gypsy
    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots This be a gray eye or so
    but not to the purpose Signior Romeo bon jour Theres a French
    salutation to your French slop You gave us the counterfeit
    fairly last night

  Rom Good morrow to you both What counterfeit did I give you

  Mer The slip sir the slip Can you not conceive

  Rom Pardon good Mercutio My business was great and in such a
    case as mine a man may strain courtesy

  Mer Thats as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a
    man to bow in the hams

  Rom Meaning to cursy

  Mer Thou hast most kindly hit it

  Rom A most courteous exposition

  Mer Nay I am the very pink of courtesy

  Rom Swits and spurs swits and spurs or Ill cry a match

  Mer Nay if our wits run the wildgoose chase I am done for
    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than I am
    sure I have in my whole five Was I with you there for the goose

  Rom And is it not then well servd in to a sweet goose

  Mer O heres a wit of cheveril that stretches from an inch
    narrow to an ell broad

  Rom I stretch it out for that word broad which added to
    the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose

  Mer Why is not this better now than groaning for love Now
    art thou sociable now art thou Romeo now art thou what thou art by
    art as well as by nature For this drivelling love is like a
    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
    a hole

  Ben Stop there stop there

  Mer Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair

  Ben Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large

  Mer O thou art deceivd I would have made it short for I
    was come to the whole depth of my tale and meant indeed to

                   An old hare hoar
                   And an old hare hoar
                Is very good meat in Lent
                   But a hare that is hoar
                   Is too much for a score
                When it hoars ere it be spent

    Romeo will you come to your fathers Well to dinner thither

  Rom I will follow you

Scene V
Capulets orchard

Enter Juliet


  Jul The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse
    In half an hour she promisd to return
    Perchance she cannot meet him Thats not so
    O she is lame Loves heralds should be thoughts
    Which ten times faster glide than the suns beams
    Driving back shadows over lowring hills
    Therefore do nimblepiniond doves draw Love
    And therefore hath the windswift Cupid wings
    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
    Of this days journey and from nine till twelve
    Is three long hours yet she is not come
    Had she affections and warm youthful blood
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love
    And his to me
    But old folks many feign as they were dead
    Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead

                      Enter Nurse and Peter

    O God she comes O honey nurse what news

  Jul Now good sweet nurse O Lord why lookst thou sad
    Though news be sad yet tell them merrily

  Jul I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news
    Nay come I pray thee speak Good good nurse speak

  Nurse Jesu what haste Can you not stay awhile
    Do you not see that I am out of breath

  Jul How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
    To say to me that thou art out of breath
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
    Is thy news good or bad Answer to that
    Say either and Ill stay the circumstance
    Let me be satisfied ist good or bad

  Nurse Well you have made a simple choice you know not how to
    choose a man Romeo No not he Though his face be better
    than any mans yet his leg excels all mens and for a hand and a
    foot and a body though they be not to be talkd on yet
    they are past compare He is not the flower of courtesy but Ill
    warrant him as gentle as a lamb Go thy ways wench serve

    Beshrew your heart for sending me about
    To catch my death with jauncing up and down

  Jul I faith I am sorry that thou art not well
    Sweet sweet Sweet nurse tell me what says my love

  Nurse Your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous
    and a kind and a handsome and I warrant a virtuous Where

    Where should she be How oddly thou repliest
    Your love says like an honest gentleman

    To fetch a ladder by the which your love
    Must climb a birds nest soon when it is dark
    I am the drudge and toil in your delight
    But you shall bear the burthen soon at night
    Go Ill to dinner hie you to the cell

  Jul Hie to high fortune Honest nurse farewell

Scene VI
Friar Laurences cell

Enter Friar Laurence and Romeo


  Friar So smile the heavens upon this holy act
    That afterhours with sorrow chide us not

  Rom Amen amen But come what sorrow can
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    That one short minute gives me in her sight
    Do thou but close our hands with holy words
    Then lovedevouring death do what he dare
    It is enough I may but call her mine

  Friar These violent delights have violent ends
    And in their triumph die like fire and powder
    Which as they kiss consume The sweetest honey
    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
    And in the taste confounds the appetite
    Therefore love moderately long love doth so
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow

                     Enter Juliet

    Here comes the lady O so light a foot
    Will neer wear out the everlasting flint
    A lover may bestride the gossamer
    That idles in the wanton summer air
    And yet not fall so light is vanity

  Jul Good even to my ghostly confessor

  Friar Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both

  Jul As much to him else is his thanks too much

  Rom Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy
    Be heapd like mine and that thy skill be more
    To blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
    This neighbour air and let rich musics tongue
    Unfold the imagind happiness that both
    Receive in either by this dear encounter

  Jul Conceit more rich in matter than in words
    Brags of his substance not of ornament
    They are but beggars that can count their worth
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth

  Friar Come come with me and we will make short work
    For by your leaves you shall not stay alone
    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one
                                                       Exeunt




ACT III Scene I
A public place

Enter Mercutio Benvolio and Men


  Ben I pray thee good Mercutio lets retire
    The day is hot the Capulets abroad
    And if we meet we shall not scape a brawl
    For now these hot days is the mad blood stirring

  Mer Thou art like one of these fellows that when he enters
    the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and
    says God send me no need of thee and by the operation of the
    second cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no need

  Ben Am I like such a fellow

  Mer Come come thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
    Italy and as soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be
    moved

  Ben And what to

  Mer Nay an there were two such we should have none shortly
    for one would kill the other Thou why thou wilt quarrel with a
    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast

    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
    There lies the man slain by young Romeo
    That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio

  Cap Wife Tybalt my cousin O my brothers child
    O Prince O husband O the blood is spilld
    Of my dear kinsman Prince as thou art true
    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague
    O cousin cousin

  Prince Benvolio who began this bloody fray

  Ben Tybalt here slain whom Romeos hand did stay
    Romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink
    How nice the quarrel was and urgd withal
    Your high displeasure All this uttered
    With gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd
    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
    Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
    With piercing steel at bold Mercutios breast
    Who all as hot turns deadly point to point
    And with a martial scorn with one hand beats
    Cold death aside and with the other sends
    It back to Tybalt whose dexterity
    Retorts it Romeo he cries aloud
    Hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue
    His agile arm beats down their fatal points
    And twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
    Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled
    But byandby comes back to Romeo
    Who had but newly entertaind revenge
    And tot they go like lightning for ere I
    Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain
    And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly
    This is the truth or let Benvolio die

  Cap Wife He is a kinsman to the Montague
    Affection makes him false he speaks not true
    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
    And all those twenty could but kill one life
    I beg for justice which thou Prince must give
    Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live

  Prince Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio
    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe

  Mon Not Romeo Prince he was Mercutios friend
    His fault concludes but what the law should end
    The life of Tybalt

  Prince And for that offence
    Immediately we do exile him hence
    I have an interest in your hates proceeding
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding
    But Ill amerce you with so strong a fine
    That you shall all repent the loss of mine
    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses
    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
    Therefore use none Let Romeo hence in haste
    Else when he is found that hour is his last
    Bear hence this body and attend our will
    Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
                                                         Exeunt




Scene II
Capulets orchard

Enter Juliet alone


  Jul Gallop apace you fieryfooted steeds
    Towards Phoebus lodging Such a wagoner
    As Phaeton would whip you to the West
    And bring in cloudy night immediately
    Spread thy close curtain loveperforming night
    That runaway eyes may wink and Romeo
    Leap to these arms untalkd of and unseen
    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
    By their own beauties or if love be blind
    It best agrees with night Come civil night
    Thou sobersuited matron all in black
    And learn me how to lose a winning match
    Playd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
    Hood my unmannd blood bating in my cheeks
    With thy black mantle till strange love grown bold
    Think true love acted simple modesty
    Come night come Romeo come thou day in night
    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    Whiter than new snow upon a ravens back
    Come gentle night come loving blackbrowd night
    Give me my Romeo and when he shall die
    Take him and cut him out in little stars
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    That all the world will be in love with night
    And pay no worship to the garish sun
    O I have bought the mansion of a love
    But not possessd it and though I am sold
    Not yet enjoyd So tedious is this day
    As is the night before some festival
    To an impatient child that hath new robes
    And may not wear them O here comes my nurse

                Enter Nurse with cords

    And she brings news and every tongue that speaks
    But Romeos name speaks heavenly eloquence
    Now nurse what news What hast thou there the cords
    That Romeo bid thee fetch

  Nurse Ay ay the cords
                                             Throws them down

  Jul Ay me what news Why dost thou wring thy hands

  Nurse Ah weraday hes dead hes dead hes dead
    We are undone lady we are undone
    Alack the day hes gone hes killd hes dead

  Jul Can heaven be so envious

  Nurse Romeo can
    Though heaven cannot O Romeo Romeo
    Who ever would have thought it Romeo

  Jul What devil art thou that dost torment me thus
    This torture should be roard in dismal hell
    Hath Romeo slain himself Say thou but I
    And that bare vowel I shall poison more
    Than the deathdarting eye of cockatrice
    I am not I if there be such an I
    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer I
    If be be slain say I or if not no
    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe

  Nurse I saw the wound I saw it with mine eyes
    God save the mark here on his manly breast
    A piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
    Pale pale as ashes all bedaubd in blood
    All in goreblood I swounded at the sight

  Jul O break my heart poor bankrout break at once
    To prison eyes neer look on liberty
    Vile earth to earth resign end motion here
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier

  Nurse O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had
    O courteous Tybalt honest gentleman
    That ever I should live to see thee dead

  Jul What storm is this that blows so contrary
    Is Romeo slaughtred and is Tybalt dead
    My dearlovd cousin and my dearer lord
    Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
    For who is living if those two are gone

  Nurse Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished
    Romeo that killd him he is banished

  Jul O God Did Romeos hand shed Tybalts blood

  Nurse It did it did alas the day it did

  Jul O serpent heart hid with a flowring face
    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
    Beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
    Dovefeatherd raven wolvishravening lamb
    Despised substance of divinest show
    Just opposite to what thou justly seemst
    A damned saint an honourable villain
    O nature what hadst thou to do in hell
    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh
    Was ever book containing such vile matter
    So fairly bound O that deceit should dwell
    In such a gorgeous palace

  Nurse Theres no trust
    No faith no honesty in men all perjurd
    All forsworn all naught all dissemblers
    Ah wheres my man Give me some aqua vitae
    These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
    Shame come to Romeo

  Jul Blisterd be thy tongue
    For such a wish He was not born to shame
    Upon his brow shame is ashamd to sit
    For tis a throne where honour may be crownd
    Sole monarch of the universal earth
    O what a beast was I to chide at him

  Nurse Will you speak well of him that killd your cousin

  Jul Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband
    Ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
    When I thy threehours wife have mangled it
    But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
    That villain cousin would have killd my husband
    Back foolish tears back to your native spring
    Your tributary drops belong to woe
    Which you mistaking offer up to joy
    My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain
    And Tybalts dead that would have slain my husband
    All this is comfort wherefore weep I then
    Some word there was worser than Tybalts death
    That murdred me I would forget it fain
    But O it presses to my memory
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
    Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished
    That banished that one word banished
    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts Tybalts death
    Was woe enough if it had ended there
    Or if sour woe delights in fellowship
    And needly will be rankd with other griefs
    Why followed not when she said Tybalts dead
    Thy father or thy mother nay or both
    Which modern lamentation might have movd
    But with a rearward following Tybalts death
    Romeo is banished to speak that word
    Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet
    All slain all dead Romeo is banished
    There is no end no limit measure bound
    In that words death no words can that woe sound
    Where is my father and my mother nurse

  Nurse Weeping and wailing over Tybalts corse
    Will you go to them I will bring you thither

  Jul Wash they his wounds with tears Mine shall be spent
    When theirs are dry for Romeos banishment
    Take up those cords Poor ropes you are beguild
    Both you and I for Romeo is exild
    He made you for a highway to my bed
    But I a maid die maidenwidowed
    Come cords come nurse Ill to my wedding bed
    And death not Romeo take my maidenhead

  Nurse Hie to your chamber Ill find Romeo
    To comfort you I wot well where he is
    Hark ye your Romeo will be here at night
    Ill to him he is hid at Laurence cell

  Jul O find him give this ring to my true knight
    And bid him come to take his last farewell
                                                         Exeunt

Enter Friar Laurence


  Friar Romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man
    Affliction is enanmourd of thy parts
    And thou art wedded to calamity

                         Enter Romeo


  Rom Father what news What is the Princes doom
    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
    That I yet know not

  Friar Too familiar
    Is my dear son with such sour company
    I bring thee tidings of the Princes doom

  Rom What less than doomsday is the Princes doom

  Friar A gentler judgment vanishd from his lips
    Not bodys death but bodys banishment

  Rom Ha banishment Be merciful say death
    For exile hath more terror in his look
    Much more than death Do not say banishment

  Friar Hence from Verona art thou banished
    Be patient for the world is broad and wide

  Rom There is no world without Verona walls
    But purgatory torture hell itself
    Hence banished is banishd from the world
    And worlds exile is death Then banishment
    Is death mistermd Calling death banishment
    Thou cutst my head off with a golden axe
    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me

  Friar O deadly sin O rude unthankfulness
    Thy fault our law calls death but the kind Prince
    Taking thy part hath rushd aside the law
    And turnd that black word death to banishment
    This is dear mercy and thou seest it not

  Rom Tis torture and not mercy Heaven is here
    Where Juliet lives and every cat and dog
    And little mouse every unworthy thing
    Live here in heaven and may look on her
    But Romeo may not More validity
    More honourable state more courtship lives
    In carrion flies than Romeo They may seize
    On the white wonder of dear Juliets hand
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips
    Who even in pure and vestal modesty
    Still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
    But Romeo may not he is banished
    This may flies do when I from this must fly
    They are free men but I am banished
    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death
    Hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife
    No sudden mean of death though neer so mean
    But banished to kill me banished
    O friar the damned use that word in hell
    Howling attends it How hast thou the heart
    Being a divine a ghostly confessor
    A sinabsolver and my friend professd
    To mangle me with that word banished

  Friar Thou fond mad man hear me a little speak

  Rom O thou wilt speak again of banishment

  Friar Ill give thee armour to keep off that word
    Adversitys sweet milk philosophy
    To comfort thee though thou art banished

  Rom Yet banished Hang up philosophy
    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet
    Displant a town reverse a princes doom
    It helps not it prevails not Talk no more

  Friar O then I see that madmen have no ears

  Rom How should they when that wise men have no eyes

  Friar Let me dispute with thee of thy estate

  Rom Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
    Wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love
    An hour but married Tybalt murdered
    Doting like me and like me banished
    Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
    And fall upon the ground as I do now
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave
                                                 Knock within

  Friar Arise one knocks Good Romeo hide thyself

  Rom Not I unless the breath of heartsick groans
    Mistlike infold me from the search of eyes          Knock

  Friar Hark how they knock Whos there Romeo arise
    Thou wilt be taken Stay awhile Stand up          Knock
    Run to my study Byandby Gods will
    What simpleness is this I come I come             Knock
    Who knocks so hard Whence come you Whats your will

  Nurse within Let me come in and you shall know my errand
    I come from Lady Juliet

  Friar Welcome then

                       Enter Nurse


  Nurse O holy friar O tell me holy friar
    Where is my ladys lord wheres Romeo

  Friar There on the ground with his own tears made drunk

  Nurse O he is even in my mistress case
    Just in her case

  Friar O woeful sympathy
    Piteous predicament

  Nurse Even so lies she
    Blubbring and weeping weeping and blubbering
    Stand up stand up Stand an you be a man
    For Juliets sake for her sake rise and stand
    Why should you fall into so deep an O

  Rom rises Nurse

  Nurse Ah sir ah sir Well deaths the end of all

  Rom Spakest thou of Juliet How is it with her
    Doth not she think me an old murtherer
    Now I have staind the childhood of our joy
    With blood removd but little from her own
    Where is she and how doth she and what says
    My conceald lady to our cancelld love

  Nurse O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
    And now falls on her bed and then starts up
    And Tybalt calls and then on Romeo cries
    And then down falls again

  Rom As if that name
    Shot from the deadly level of a gun
    Did murther her as that names cursed hand
    Murderd her kinsman O tell me friar tell me
    In what vile part of this anatomy
    Doth my name lodge Tell me that I may sack
    The hateful mansion                     Draws his dagger

  Friar Hold thy desperate hand
    Art thou a man Thy form cries out thou art
    Thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
    The unreasonable fury of a beast
    Unseemly woman in a seeming man
    Or illbeseeming beast in seeming both
    Thou hast amazd me By my holy order
    I thought thy disposition better temperd
    Hast thou slain Tybalt Wilt thou slay thyself
    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives
    By doing damned hate upon thyself
    Why railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
    Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
    In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
    Fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit
    Which like a usurer aboundst in all
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
    Digressing from the valour of a man
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
    Killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish
    Thy wit that ornament to shape and love
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both
    Like powder in a skilless soldiers flask
    is get afire by thine own ignorance
    And thou dismembred with thine own defence
    What rouse thee man Thy Juliet is alive
    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
    There art thou happy Tybalt would kill thee
    But thou slewest Tybalt There art thou happy too
    The law that threatned death becomes thy friend
    And turns it to exile There art thou happy
    A pack of blessings light upon thy back
    Happiness courts thee in her best array
    But like a misbhavd and sullen wench
    Thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love
    Take heed take heed for such die miserable
    Go get thee to thy love as was decreed
    Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
    But look thou stay not till the watch be set
    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua
    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
    To blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
    Beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back
    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy

Scene V
Capulets orchard

Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft at the Window


  Jul Wilt thou be gone It is not yet near day
    It was the nightingale and not the lark
    That piercd the fearful hollow of thine ear
    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree
    Believe me love it was the nightingale

  Rom It was the lark the herald of the morn
    No nightingale Look love what envious streaks
    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East
    Nights candles are burnt out and jocund day
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
    I must be gone and live or stay and die

  Jul Yond light is not daylight I know it I
    It is some meteor that the sun exhales
    To be to thee this night a torchbearer
    And light thee on the way to Mantua
    Therefore stay yet thou needst not to be gone

  Rom Let me be taen let me be put to death
    I am content so thou wilt have it so
    Ill say yon grey is not the mornings eye
    Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthias brow
    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads
    I have more care to stay than will to go
    Come death and welcome Juliet wills it so
    How ist my soul Lets talk it is not day

  Jul It is it is Hie hence be gone away
    It is the lark that sings so out of tune
    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
    Some say the lark makes sweet division
    This doth not so for she divideth us
    Some say the lark and loathed toad changd eyes
    O now I would they had changd voices too
    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
    Hunting thee hence with huntsup to the day
    O now be gone More light and light it grows

  Rom More light and light more dark and dark our woes

                          Enter Nurse

  Rom Farewell farewell One kiss and Ill descend
                                                  He goeth down

  Jul Art thou gone so my lord my love my friend
    I must hear from thee every day in the hour
    For in a minute there are many days
    O by this count I shall be much in years
    Ere I again behold my Romeo

  Rom Farewell
    I will omit no opportunity
    That may convey my greetings love to thee

  Jul O thinkst thou we shall ever meet again

  Rom I doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
    For sweet discourses in our time to come

  Jul O God I have an illdivining soul
    Methinks I see thee now thou art below
    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb
    Either my eyesight fails or thou lookst pale

  Rom And trust me love in my eye so do you
    Dry sorrow drinks our blood Adieu adieu
Exit

  Jul O Fortune Fortune all men call thee fickle
    If thou art fickle what dost thou with him
    That is renownd for faith Be fickle Fortune
    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
    But send him back

  Lady within Ho daughter are you up

  Jul Who ist that calls It is my lady mother
    Is she not down so late or up so early
    What unaccustomd cause procures her hither

                       Enter Mother


  Lady Why how now Juliet

  Jul Madam I am not well

  Lady Evermore weeping for your cousins death
    What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
    An if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
    Therefore have done Some grief shows much of love
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit

  Jul Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss

  Lady So shall you feel the loss but not the friend
    Which you weep for

  Jul Feeling so the loss
    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend

  Lady Well girl thou weepst not so much for his death
    As that the villain lives which slaughterd him

  Jul What villain madam

  Lady That same villain Romeo

  Jul aside Villain and he be many miles asunder
    God pardon him I do with all my heart
    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart

  Lady That is because the traitor murderer lives

  Jul Ay madam from the reach of these my hands
    Would none but I might venge my cousins death

  Lady We will have vengeance for it fear thou not
    Then weep no more Ill send to one in Mantua
    Where that same banishd runagate doth live
    Shall give him such an unaccustomd dram
    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company
    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied

  Jul Indeed I never shall be satisfied
    With Romeo till I behold him dead
    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vexd
    Madam if you could find out but a man
    To bear a poison I would temper it
    That Romeo should upon receipt thereof
    Soon sleep in quiet O how my heart abhors
    To hear him namd and cannot come to him
    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
    Upon his body that hath slaughterd him

  Lady Find thou the means and Ill find such a man
    But now Ill tell thee joyful tidings girl

  Jul And joy comes well in such a needy time
    What are they I beseech your ladyship

  Lady Well well thou hast a careful father child
    One who to put thee from thy heaviness
    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
    That thou expects not nor I lookd not for

  Jul Madam in happy time What day is that

  Lady Marry my child early next Thursday morn
    The gallant young and noble gentleman
    The County Paris at Saint Peters Church
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride

  Jul Now by Saint Peters Church and Peter too
    He shall not make me there a joyful bride
    I wonder at this haste that I must wed
    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo
    I pray you tell my lord and father madam
    I will not marry yet and when I do I swear
    It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate
    Rather than Paris These are news indeed

  Lady Here comes your father Tell him so yourself
    And see how be will take it at your hands

                   Enter Capulet and Nurse

    But for the sunset of my brothers son
    It rains downright
    How now a conduit girl What still in tears
    Evermore showring In one little body
    Thou counterfeitst a bark a sea a wind
    For still thy eyes which I may call the sea
    Do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
    Sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
    Who raging with thy tears and they with them
    Without a sudden calm will overset
    Thy tempesttossed body How now wife
    Have you delivered to her our decree

    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain

ACT IV Scene I
Friar Laurences cell

Enter Friar Laurence and County Paris


  Friar On Thursday sir The time is very short

  Par My father Capulet will have it so
    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste

  Friar You say you do not know the ladys mind
    Uneven is the course I like it not

  Par Immoderately she weeps for Tybalts death
    And therefore have I little talkd of love
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears
    Now sir her father counts it dangerous
    That she do give her sorrow so much sway
    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
    To stop the inundation of her tears
    Which too much minded by herself alone
    May be put from her by society
    Now do you know the reason of this haste

  Friar aside I would I knew not why it should be slowd
    Look sir here comes the lady toward my cell

                    Enter Juliet


  Par Happily met my lady and my wife

  Jul That may be sir when I may be a wife

  Par That may be must be love on Thursday next

  Jul What must be shall be

  Friar Thats a certain text

  Par Come you to make confession to this father

  Jul To answer that I should confess to you

  Par Do not deny to him that you love me

  Jul I will confess to you that I love him

  Par So will ye I am sure that you love me

  Jul If I do so it will be of more price
    Being spoke behind your back than to your face

  Par Poor soul thy face is much abusd with tears

  Jul The tears have got small victory by that
    For it was bad enough before their spite

  Par Thou wrongst it more than tears with that report

  Jul That is no slander sir which is a truth
    And what I spake I spake it to my face

  Par Thy face is mine and thou hast slandred it

  Jul It may be so for it is not mine own
    Are you at leisure holy father now
    Or shall I come to you at evening mass

  Friar My leisure serves me pensive daughter now
    My lord we must entreat the time alone

  Par God shield I should disturb devotion
    Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye
    Till then adieu and keep this holy kiss             Exit

  Jul O shut the door and when thou hast done so
    Come weep with me past hope past cure past help

  Friar Ah Juliet I already know thy grief
    It strains me past the compass of my wits
    I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
    On Thursday next be married to this County

  Jul Tell me not friar that thou hearst of this
    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
    Do thou but call my resolution wise
    And with this knife Ill help it presently
    God joind my heart and Romeos thou our hands
    And ere this hand by thee to Romeos seald
    Shall be the label to another deed
    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
    Turn to another this shall slay them both
    Therefore out of thy longexperiencd time
    Give me some present counsel or behold
    Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
    Shall play the empire arbitrating that
    Which the commission of thy years and art
    Could to no issue of true honour bring
    Be not so long to speak I long to die
    If what thou speakst speak not of remedy

  Friar Hold daughter I do spy a kind of hope
    Which craves as desperate an execution
    As that is desperate which we would prevent
    If rather than to marry County Paris
    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
    A thing like death to chide away this shame
    That copst with death himself to scape from it
    And if thou darst Ill give thee remedy

  Jul O bid me leap rather than marry Paris
    From off the battlements of yonder tower
    Or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
    Where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house
    Oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones
    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
    Or bid me go into a newmade grave
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud
    Things that to hear them told have made me tremble
    And I will do it without fear or doubt
    To live an unstaind wife to my sweet love

  Friar Hold then Go home be merry give consent
    To marry Paris Wednesday is tomorrow
    Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
    Take thou this vial being then in bed
    And this distilled liquor drink thou off
    When presently through all thy veins shall run
    A cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
    Shall keep his native progress but surcease
    No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
    To paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
    Like death when he shuts up the day of life
    Each part deprivd of supple government
    Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
    Thou shalt continue twoandforty hours
    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep
    Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
    To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
    Then as the manner of our country is
    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie
    In the mean time against thou shalt awake
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift
    And hither shall he come and he and I
    Will watch thy waking and that very night
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua
    And this shall free thee from this present shame
    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
    Abate thy valour in the acting it

  Jul Give me give me O tell not me of fear

  Friar Hold Get you gone be strong and prosperous
    In this resolve Ill send a friar with speed
    To Mantua with my letters to thy lord

  Jul Love give me strength and strength shall help afford
    Farewell dear father
                                                         Exeunt

                          Enter Mother


  Mother What are you busy ho Need you my help

  Jul No madam we have culld such necessaries
    As are behooffull for our state tomorrow
    So please you let me now be left alone
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you
    For I am sure you have your hands full all
    In this so sudden business

  Mother Good night
    Get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need
                                      Exeunt Mother and Nurse

  Jul Farewell God knows when we shall meet again
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
    That almost freezes up the heat of life
    Ill call them back again to comfort me
    Nurse What should she do here
    My dismal scene I needs must act alone
    Come vial
    What if this mixture do not work at all
    Shall I be married then tomorrow morning
    No No This shall forbid it Lie thou there
                                             Lays down a dagger
    What if it be a poison which the friar
    Subtilly hath ministred to have me dead
    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd
    Because he married me before to Romeo
    I fear it is and yet methinks it should not
    For he hath still been tried a holy man
    I will not entertain so bad a thought
    How if when I am laid into the tomb
    I wake before the time that Romeo
    Come to redeem me Theres a fearful point
    Shall I not then be stifled in the vault
    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes
    Or if I live is it not very like
    The horrible conceit of death and night
    Together with the terror of the place
    As in a vault an ancient receptacle
    Where for this many hundred years the bones
    Of all my buried ancestors are packd
    Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth
    Lies festring in his shroud where as they say
    At some hours in the night spirits resort
    Alack alack is it not like that I
    So early waking what with loathsome smells
    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
    That living mortals hearing them run mad
    O if I wake shall I not be distraught
    Environed with all these hideous fears
    And madly play with my forefathers joints
    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud
    And in this rage with some great kinsmans bone
    As with a club dash out my desprate brains
    O look methinks I see my cousins ghost
    Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
    Upon a rapiers point Stay Tybalt stay
    Romeo I come this do I drink to thee

        She drinks and falls upon her bed within the curtains

ACT V Scene I
Mantua A street

Enter Romeo


  Rom If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
    My bosoms lord sits lightly in his throne
    And all this day an unaccustomd spirit
    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
    Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think
    And breathd such life with kisses in my lips
    That I revivd and was an emperor
    Ah me how sweet is love itself possessd
    When but loves shadows are so rich in joy

                Enter Romeos Man Balthasar booted

    News from Verona How now Balthasar
    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
    How doth my lady Is my father well
    How fares my Juliet That I ask again
    For nothing can be ill if she be well

  Man Then she is well and nothing can be ill
    Her body sleeps in Capels monument
    And her immortal part with angels lives
    I saw her laid low in her kindreds vault
    And presently took post to tell it you
    O pardon me for bringing these ill news
    Since you did leave it for my office sir

  Rom Is it een so Then I defy you stars
    Thou knowest my lodging Get me ink and paper
    And hire posthorses I will hence tonight

  Man I do beseech you sir have patience
    Your looks are pale and wild and do import
    Some misadventure

  Rom Tush thou art deceivd
    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do
    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar

  Man No my good lord

  Rom No matter Get thee gone
    And hire those horses Ill be with thee straight
                                               Exit Balthasar
    Well Juliet I will lie with thee tonight
    Lets see for means O mischief thou art swift
    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men
    I do remember an apothecary
    And hereabouts a dwells which late I noted
    In tattred weeds with overwhelming brows
    Culling of simples Meagre were his looks
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones
    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung
    An alligator stuffd and other skins
    Of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
    A beggarly account of empty boxes
    Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
    Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
    Were thinly scattered to make up a show
    Noting this penury to myself I said
    An if a man did need a poison now
    Whose sale is present death in Mantua
    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
    O this same thought did but forerun my need
    And this same needy man must sell it me
    As I remember this should be the house
    Being holiday the beggars shop is shut What ho apothecary

                        Enter Apothecary


  Apoth Who calls so loud

  Rom Come hither man I see that thou art poor
    Hold there is forty ducats Let me have
    A dram of poison such soonspeeding gear
    As will disperse itself through all the veins
    That the lifeweary taker mall fall dead
    And that the trunk may be dischargd of breath
    As violently as hasty powder fird
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb

  Apoth Such mortal drugs I have but Mantuas law
    Is death to any he that utters them

  Rom Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
    And fearest to die Famine is in thy cheeks
    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
    The world is not thy friend nor the worlds law
    The world affords no law to make thee rich
    Then be not poor but break it and take this

  Apoth My poverty but not my will consents

  Rom I pay thy poverty and not thy will

  Apoth Put this in any liquid thing you will
    And drink it off and if you had the strength
    Of twenty men it would dispatch you straight

  Rom There is thy gold worse poison to mens souls
    Doing more murther in this loathsome world
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
    I sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
    Farewell Buy food and get thyself in flesh
    Come cordial and not poison go with me
    To Juliets grave for there must I use thee
                                                         Exeunt

    Welcome from Mantua What says Romeo
    Or if his mind be writ give me his letter

  John Going to find a barefoot brother out
    One of our order to associate me
    Here in this city visiting the sick
    And finding him the searchers of the town
    Suspecting that we both were in a house
    Where the infectious pestilence did reign
    Seald up the doors and would not let us forth
    So that my speed to Mantua there was stayd

  Laur Who bare my letter then to Romeo

  John I could not send it here it is again
    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee
    So fearful were they of infection

  Laur Unhappy fortune By my brotherhood
    The letter was not nice but full of charge
    Of dear import and the neglecting it
    May do much danger Friar John go hence
    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
    Unto my cell

  John Brother Ill go and bring it thee                 Exit

  Laur Now must I to the monument alone
    Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake
    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
    Hath had no notice of these accidents
    But I will write again to Mantua
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come

Scene III
Verona A churchyard in it the monument of the Capulets

Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and a torch


  Par Give me thy torch boy Hence and stand aloof
    Yet put it out for I would not be seen
    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along
    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground
    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
    Being loose unfirm with digging up of graves
    But thou shalt hear it Whistle then to me
    As signal that thou hearst something approach
    Give me those flowers Do as I bid thee go

  Page aside I am almost afraid to stand alone
    Here in the churchyard yet I will adventure     Retires

  Par Sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
    O woe thy canopy is dust and stones
    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew
    Or wanting that with tears distilld by moans
    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
    Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
                                                    Whistle Boy
    The boy gives warning something doth approach
    What cursed foot wanders this way tonight
    To cross my obsequies and true loves rite
    What with a torch Muffle me night awhile     Retires

       Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch a mattock
                    and a crow of iron


  Rom Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
    Hold take this letter Early in the morning
    See thou deliver it to my lord and father
    Give me the light Upon thy life I charge thee
    Whateer thou hearest or seest stand all aloof
    And do not interrupt me in my course
    Why I descend into this bed of death
    Is partly to behold my ladys face
    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
    A precious ring a ring that I must use
    In dear employment Therefore hence be gone
    But if thou jealous dost return to pry
    In what I farther shall intend to do
    By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint
    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
    The time and my intents are savagewild
    More fierce and more inexorable far
    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea

  Bal I will be gone sir and not trouble you

  Rom So shalt thou show me friendship Take thou that
    Live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow

  Bal aside For all this same Ill hide me hereabout
    His looks I fear and his intents I doubt        Retires

  Rom Thou detestable maw thou womb of death
    Gorgd with the dearest morsel of the earth
    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open
    And in despite Ill cram thee with more food
                                           Romeo opens the tomb

  Par This is that banishd haughty Montague
    That murdred my loves cousin with which grief
    It is supposed the fair creature died
    And here is come to do some villanous shame
    To the dead bodies I will apprehend him
    Stop thy unhallowed toil vile Montague
    Can vengeance be pursud further than death
    Condemned villain I do apprehend thee
    Obey and go with me for thou must die

  Rom I must indeed and therefore came I hither
    Good gentle youth tempt not a desprate man
    Fly hence and leave me Think upon these gone
    Let them affright thee I beseech thee youth
    But not another sin upon my head
    By urging me to fury O be gone
    By heaven I love thee better than myself
    For I come hither armd against myself
    Stay not be gone Live and hereafter say
    A madmans mercy bid thee run away

  Par I do defy thy conjuration
    And apprehend thee for a felon here

  Rom Wilt thou provoke me Then have at thee boy
                                                     They fight

  Page O Lord they fight I will go call the watch
                                            Exit Paris falls

  Par O I am slain If thou be merciful
    Open the tomb lay me with Juliet                   Dies

  Rom In faith I will Let me peruse this face
    Mercutios kinsman noble County Paris
    What said my man when my betossed soul
    Did not attend him as we rode I think
    He told me Paris should have married Juliet
    Said he not so or did I dream it so
    Or am I mad hearing him talk of Juliet
    To think it was so O give me thy hand
    One writ with me in sour misfortunes book
    Ill bury thee in a triumphant grave
    A grave O no a lanthorn slaughtred youth
    For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes
    This vault a feasting presence full of light
    Death lie thou there by a dead man interrd
                                         Lays him in the tomb
    How oft when men are at the point of death
    Have they been merry which their keepers call
    A lightning before death O how may I
    Call this a lightning O my love my wife
    Death that hath suckd the honey of thy breath
    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
    Thou art not conquerd Beautys ensign yet
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
    And deaths pale flag is not advanced there
    Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
    O what more favour can I do to thee
    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
    To sunder his that was thine enemy
    Forgive me cousin Ah dear Juliet
    Why art thou yet so fair Shall I believe
    That unsubstantial Death is amorous
    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
    Thee here in dark to be his paramour
    For fear of that I still will stay with thee
    And never from this palace of dim night
    Depart again Here here will I remain
    With worms that are thy chambermaids O here
    Will I set up my everlasting rest
    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    From this worldwearied flesh Eyes look your last
    Arms take your last embrace and lips O you
    The doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death

  Bal As I did sleep under this yew tree here
    I dreamt my master and another fought
    And that my master slew him

  Friar Romeo
    Alack alack what blood is this which stains
    The stony entrance of this sepulchre

    Romeo O pale Who else What Paris too
    And steepd in blood Ah what an unkind hour

  Jul O comfortable friar where is my lord
    I do remember well where I should be
    And there I am Where is my Romeo

    Of death contagion and unnatural sleep

    Hath thwarted our intents Come come away

    And Paris too Come Ill dispose of thee

    Whats here A cup closd in my true loves hand
    Poison I see hath been his timeless end
    O churl drunk all and left no friendly drop
    To help me after I will kiss thy lips
    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
    To make me die with a restorative             Kisses him
    Thy lips are warm

  Chief Watch within Lead boy Which way
    Yea noise Then Ill be brief O happy dagger
                                      Snatches Romeos dagger
    This is thy sheath there rest and let me die
                  She stabs herself and falls on Romeos body

                Enter Pariss Boy and Watch


  Boy This is the place There where the torch doth burn

  Chief Watch the ground is bloody Search about the churchyard
    Go some of you whoeer you find attach
                                     Exeunt some of the Watch
    Pitiful sight here lies the County slain
    And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead
    Who here hath lain this two days buried
    Go tell the Prince run to the Capulets
    Raise up the Montagues some others search
                                   Exeunt others of the Watch
    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie
    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
    We cannot without circumstance descry

     Enter some of the Watch with Romeos Man Balthasar

  2 Watch Heres Romeos man We found him in the churchyard

  Chief Watch Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither

          Enter Friar Laurence and another Watchman

  3 Watch Here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
    We took this mattock and this spade from him
    As he was coming from this churchyard side

  Chief Watch A great suspicion Stay the friar too

              Enter the Prince and Attendants


  Prince What misadventure is so early up
    That calls our person from our morning rest

            Enter Capulet and his Wife with others


  Cap What should it be that they so shriek abroad

  Wife The people in the street cry Romeo
    Some Juliet and some Paris and all run
    With open outcry toward our monument

  Prince What fear is this which startles in our ears

  Chief Watch Sovereign here lies the County Paris slain
    And Romeo dead and Juliet dead before
    Warm and new killd

  Prince Search seek and know how this foul murder comes

  Chief Watch Here is a friar and slaughterd Romeos man
    With instruments upon them fit to open
    These dead mens tombs

  Cap O heavens O wife look how our daughter bleeds
    This dagger hath mistaen for lo his house
    Is empty on the back of Montague
    And it missheathed in my daughters bosom

  Wife O me this sight of death is as a bell
    That warns my old age to a sepulchre

               Enter Montague and others


  Prince Come Montague for thou art early up
    To see thy son and heir more early down

  Mon Alas my liege my wife is dead tonight
    Grief of my sons exile hath stoppd her breath
    What further woe conspires against mine age

  Prince Look and thou shalt see

  Mon O thou untaught what manners is in this
    To press before thy father to a grave

  Prince Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
    Till we can clear these ambiguities
    And know their spring their head their true descent
    And then will I be general of your woes
    And lead you even to death Meantime forbear
    And let mischance be slave to patience
    Bring forth the parties of suspicion

  Friar I am the greatest able to do least
    Yet most suspected as the time and place
    Doth make against me of this direful murther
    And here I stand both to impeach and purge
    Myself condemned and myself excusd

  Prince Then say it once what thou dost know in this

  Friar I will be brief for my short date of breath
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale
    Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet
    And she there dead that Romeos faithful wife
    I married them and their stoln marriage day
    Was Tybalts doomsday whose untimely death
    Banishd the newmade bridegroom from this city
    For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pind
    You to remove that siege of grief from her
    Betrothd and would have married her perforce
    To County Paris Then comes she to me
    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    To rid her from this second marriage
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself
    Then gave I her so tutored by my art
    A sleeping potion which so took effect
    As I intended for it wrought on her
    The form of death Meantime I writ to Romeo
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    To help to take her from her borrowed grave
    Being the time the potions force should cease
    But he which bore my letter Friar John
    Was stayd by accident and yesternight
    Returnd my letter back Then all alone
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    Came I to take her from her kindreds vault
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo
    But when I came some minute ere the time
    Of her awaking here untimely lay
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead
    She wakes and I entreated her come forth
    And bear this work of heaven with patience
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb
    And she too desperate would not go with me
    But as it seems did violence on herself
    All this I know and to the marriage
    Her nurse is privy and if aught in this
    Miscarried by my fault let my old life
    Be sacrificd some hour before his time
    Unto the rigour of severest law

  Prince We still have known thee for a holy man
    Wheres Romeos man What can he say in this

  Bal I brought my master news of Juliets death
    And then in post he came from Mantua
    To this same place to this same monument
    This letter he early bid me give his father
    And threatned me with death going in the vault
    If I departed not and left him there

  Prince Give me the letter I will look on it
    Where is the Countys page that raisd the watch
    Sirrah what made your master in this place

  Boy He came with flowers to strew his ladys grave
    And bid me stand aloof and so I did
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
    And byandby my master drew on him
    And then I ran away to call the watch

  Prince This letter doth make good the friars words
    Their course of love the tidings of her death
    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
    Of a poor pothecary and therewithal
    Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet
    Where be these enemies Capulet Montage
    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
    And I for winking at you discords too
    Have lost a brace of kinsmen All are punishd

  Cap O brother Montague give me thy hand
    This is my daughters jointure for no more
    Can I demand

  Mon But I can give thee more
    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold
    That whiles Verona by that name is known
    There shall no figure at such rate be set
    As that of true and faithful Juliet

  Cap As rich shall Romeos by his ladys lie
    Poor sacrifices of our enmity

  Prince A glooming peace this morning with it brings
    The sun for sorrow will not show his head
    Go hence to have more talk of these sad things
    Some shall be pardond and some punished
    For never was a story of more woe
    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo
                                                   Exeunt omnes

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we will have to do four text
files per month  thus upping our productivity from one million
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31 2001  10000 x 100000000Trillion

SCENE Rome the conspirators camp near Sardis  and the plains
of Philippi


ACT I SCENE I
Rome A street

Enter Flavius Marullus and certain Commoners

  FLAVIUS Hence home you idle creatures get you home
    Is this a holiday What know you not
    Being mechanical you ought not walk
    Upon a laboring day without the sign
    Of your profession Speak what trade art thou
  FIRST COMMONER Why sir a carpenter
  MARULLUS Where is thy leather apron and thy rule
    What dost thou with thy best apparel on
    You sir what trade are you
  SECOND COMMONER Truly sir in respect of a fine workman I am
    but as you would say a cobbler
  MARULLUS But what trade art thou Answer me directly
  SECOND COMMONER A trade sir that I hope I may use with a
safe
    conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
  MARULLUS What trade thou knave Thou naughty knave what
trade
  SECOND COMMONER Nay I beseech you sir be not out with me
yet
    if you be out sir I can mend you
  MARULLUS What meanst thou by that Mend me thou saucy
fellow
  SECOND COMMONER Why sir cobble you
  FLAVIUS Thou art a cobbler art thou
  SECOND COMMONER Truly Sir all that I live by is with the
awl I
    meddle with no tradesmans matters nor womens matters but
with
    awl I am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are
in
    great danger I recover them As proper men as ever trod upon
    neats leather have gone upon my handiwork
  FLAVIUS But wherefore art not in thy shop today
    Why dost thou lead these men about the streets
  SECOND COMMONER Truly sir to wear out their shoes to get
myself
    into more work But indeed sir we make holiday to see
Caesar
    and to rejoice in his triumph
  MARULLUS Wherefore rejoice What conquest brings he home
    What tributaries follow him to Rome
    To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
    You blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
    O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome
    Knew you not Pompey Many a time and oft
    Have you climbd up to walls and battlements
    To towers and windows yea to chimney tops
    Your infants in your arms and there have sat
    The livelong day with patient expectation
    To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
    And when you saw his chariot but appear
    Have you not made an universal shout
    That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
    To hear the replication of your sounds
    Made in her concave shores
    And do you now put on your best attire
    And do you now cull out a holiday
    And do you now strew flowers in his way
    That comes in triumph over Pompeys blood
    Be gone
    Run to your houses fall upon your knees
    Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
    That needs must light on this ingratitude
  FLAVIUS Go go good countrymen and for this fault
    Assemble all the poor men of your sort
    Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears
    Into the channel till the lowest stream
    Do kiss the most exalted shores of all
                                           Exeunt all Commoners
    See whether their basest metal be not moved
    They vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness
    Go you down that way towards the Capitol
    This way will I Disrobe the images
    If you do find them deckd with ceremonies
  MARULLUS May we do so
    You know it is the feast of Lupercal
  FLAVIUS It is no matter let no images
    Be hung with Caesars trophies Ill about
    And drive away the vulgar from the streets
    So do you too where you perceive them thick
    These growing feathers pluckd from Caesars wing
    Will make him fly an ordinary pitch
    Who else would soar above the view of men
    And keep us all in servile fearfulness              Exeunt




SCENE II
A public place

Flourish Enter Caesar Antony for the course Calpurnia
Portia
Decius Cicero Brutus Cassius and Casca a great crowd
follows
among them a Soothsayer

  CAESAR Calpurnia
  CASCA Peace ho Caesar speaks
                                                   Music ceases
  CAESAR Calpurnia
  CALPURNIA Here my lord
  CAESAR Stand you directly in Antonios way
    When he doth run his course Antonio
  ANTONY Caesar my lord
  CAESAR Forget not in your speed Antonio
    To touch Calpurnia for our elders say
    The barren touched in this holy chase
    Shake off their sterile curse
  ANTONY I shall remember
    When Caesar says Do this it is performd
  CAESAR Set on and leave no ceremony out           Flourish
  SOOTHSAYER Caesar
  CAESAR Ha Who calls
  CASCA Bid every noise be still Peace yet again
  CAESAR Who is it in the press that calls on me
    I hear a tongue shriller than all the music
    Cry Caesar Speak Caesar is turnd to hear
  SOOTHSAYER Beware the ides of March
  CAESAR What man is that
  BRUTUS A soothsayer you beware the ides of March
  CAESAR Set him before me let me see his face
  CASSIUS Fellow come from the throng look upon Caesar
  CAESAR What sayst thou to me now Speak once again
  SOOTHSAYER Beware the ides of March
  CAESAR He is a dreamer let us leave him Pass
                      Sennet Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius
  CASSIUS Will you go see the order of the course
  BRUTUS Not I
  CASSIUS I pray you do
  BRUTUS I am not gamesome I do lack some part
    Of that quick spirit that is in Antony
    Let me not hinder Cassius your desires
    Ill leave you
  CASSIUS Brutus I do observe you now of late
    I have not from your eyes that gentleness
    And show of love as I was wont to have
    You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
    Over your friend that loves you
  BRUTUS Cassius
    Be not deceived if I have veild my look
    I turn the trouble of my countenance
    Merely upon myself Vexed I am
    Of late with passions of some difference
    Conceptions only proper to myself
    Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
    But let not therefore my good friends be grieved
    Among which number Cassius be you one
    Nor construe any further my neglect
    Than that poor Brutus with himself at war
    Forgets the shows of love to other men
  CASSIUS Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion
    By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
    Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
    Tell me good Brutus can you see your face
  BRUTUS No Cassius for the eye sees not itself
    But by reflection by some other things
  CASSIUS Tis just
    And it is very much lamented Brutus
    That you have no such mirrors as will turn
    Your hidden worthiness into your eye
    That you might see your shadow I have heard
    Where many of the best respect in Rome
    Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus
    And groaning underneath this ages yoke
    Have wishd that noble Brutus had his eyes
  BRUTUS Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius
    That you would have me seek into myself
    For that which is not in me
  CASSIUS Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear
    And since you know you cannot see yourself
    So well as by reflection I your glass
    Will modestly discover to yourself
    That of yourself which you yet know not of
    And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus
    Were I a common laugher or did use
    To stale with ordinary oaths my love
    To every new protester if you know
    That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
    And after scandal them or if you know
    That I profess myself in banqueting
    To all the rout then hold me dangerous
                                             Flourish and shout
  BRUTUS What means this shouting I do fear the people
    Choose Caesar for their king
  CASSIUS Ay do you fear it
    Then must I think you would not have it so
  BRUTUS I would not Cassius yet I love him well
    But wherefore do you hold me here so long
    What is it that you would impart to me
    If it be aught toward the general good
    Set honor in one eye and death i the other
    And I will look on both indifferently
    For let the gods so speed me as I love
    The name of honor more than I fear death
  CASSIUS I know that virtue to be in you Brutus
    As well as I do know your outward favor
    Well honor is the subject of my story
    I cannot tell what you and other men
    Think of this life but for my single self
    I had as lief not be as live to be
    In awe of such a thing as I myself
    I was born free as Caesar so were you
    We both have fed as well and we can both
    Endure the winters cold as well as he
    For once upon a raw and gusty day
    The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores
    Caesar said to me Darest thou Cassius now
    Leap in with me into this angry flood
    And swim to yonder point Upon the word
    Accoutred as I was I plunged in
    And bade him follow So indeed he did
    The torrent roard and we did buffet it
    With lusty sinews throwing it aside
    And stemming it with hearts of controversy
    But ere we could arrive the point proposed
    Caesar cried Help me Cassius or I sink
    I as Aeneas our great ancestor
    Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
    The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber
    Did I the tired Caesar And this man
    Is now become a god and Cassius is
    A wretched creature and must bend his body
    If Caesar carelessly but nod on him
    He had a fever when he was in Spain
    And when the fit was on him I did mark
    How he did shake Tis true this god did shake
    His coward lips did from their color fly
    And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
    Did lose his luster I did hear him groan
    Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
    Mark him and write his speeches in their books
    Alas it cried Give me some drink Titinius
    As a sick girl Ye gods It doth amaze me
    A man of such a feeble temper should
    So get the start of the majestic world
    And bear the palm alone Shout                    Flourish
  BRUTUS Another general shout
    I do believe that these applauses are
    For some new honors that are heapd on Caesar
  CASSIUS Why man he doth bestride the narrow world
    Like a Colossus and we petty men
    Walk under his huge legs and peep about
    To find ourselves dishonorable graves
    Men at some time are masters of their fates
    The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars
    But in ourselves that we are underlings
    Brutus and Caesar what should be in that Caesar
    Why should that name be sounded more than yours
    Write them together yours is as fair a name
    Sound them it doth become the mouth as well
    Weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em
    Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar
    Now in the names of all the gods at once
    Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
    That he is grown so great Age thou art shamed
    Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
    When went there by an age since the great flood
    But it was famed with more than with one man
    When could they say till now that talkd of Rome
    That her wide walls encompassd but one man
    Now is it Rome indeed and room enough
    When there is in it but one only man
    O you and I have heard our fathers say
    There was a Brutus once that would have brookd
    The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
    As easily as a king
  BRUTUS That you do love me I am nothing jealous
    What you would work me to I have some aim
    How I have thought of this and of these times
    I shall recount hereafter for this present
    I would not so with love I might entreat you
    Be any further moved What you have said
    I will consider what you have to say
    I will with patience hear and find a time
    Both meet to hear and answer such high things
    Till then my noble friend chew upon this
    Brutus had rather be a villager
    Than to repute himself a son of Rome
    Under these hard conditions as this time
    Is like to lay upon us
  CASSIUS I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus

            Reenter Caesar and his Train

  BRUTUS The games are done and Caesar is returning
  CASSIUS As they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve
    And he will after his sour fashion tell you
    What hath proceeded worthy note today
  BRUTUS I will do so But look you Cassius
    The angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow
    And all the rest look like a chidden train
    Calpurnias cheek is pale and Cicero
    Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
    As we have seen him in the Capitol
    Being crossd in conference by some senators
  CASSIUS Casca will tell us what the matter is
  CAESAR Antonio
  ANTONY Caesar
  CAESAR Let me have men about me that are fat
    Sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights
    Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look
    He thinks too much such men are dangerous
  ANTONY Fear him not Caesar hes not dangerous
    He is a noble Roman and well given
  CAESAR Would he were fatter But I fear him not
    Yet if my name were liable to fear
    I do not know the man I should avoid
    So soon as that spare Cassius He reads much
    He is a great observer and he looks
    Quite through the deeds of men He loves no plays
    As thou dost Antony he hears no music
    Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
    As if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit
    That could be moved to smile at anything
    Such men as he be never at hearts ease
    Whiles they behold a greater than themselves
    And therefore are they very dangerous
    I rather tell thee what is to be feard
    Than what I fear for always I am Caesar
    Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
    And tell me truly what thou thinkst of him
              Sennet Exeunt Caesar and all his Train but Casca
  CASCA You pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me
  BRUTUS Ay Casca tell us what hath chanced today
    That Caesar looks so sad
  CASCA Why you were with him were you not
  BRUTUS I should not then ask Casca what had chanced
  CASCA Why there was a crown offered him and being offered
him
     he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the
     people fell ashouting
  BRUTUS What was the second noise for
  CASCA Why for that too
  CASSIUS They shouted thrice What was the last cry for
  CASCA Why for that too
  BRUTUS Was the crown offered him thrice
  CASCA Ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time
gentler
    than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors
    shouted
  CASSIUS Who offered him the crown
  CASCA Why Antony
  BRUTUS Tell us the manner of it gentle Casca
  CASCA I can as well be hangd as tell the manner of it It was
    mere foolery I did not mark it I saw Mark Antony offer him
a
    crown yet twas not a crown neither twas one of these
    coronets and as I told you he put it by once But for all
    that to my thinking he would fain have had it Then he
offered
    it to him again then he put it by again But to my
thinking he
    was very loath to lay his fingers off it And then he offered
it
    the third time he put it the third time by and still as he
    refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped
hands
    and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal
of
    stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had
    almost choked Caesar for he swounded and fell down at it
And
    for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of opening my
lips
    and receiving the bad air
  CASSIUS But soft I pray you what did Caesars wound
  CASCA He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and
was
    speechless
  BRUTUS Tis very like He hath the falling sickness
  CASSIUS No Caesar hath it not but you and I
    And honest Casca we have the falling sickness
  CASCA I know not what you mean by that but I am sure Caesar
fell
    down If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him
    according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to
do
    the players in the theatre I am no true man
  BRUTUS What said he when he came unto himself
  CASCA Marry before he fell down when he perceived the common
    herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his
doublet
    and offered them his throat to cut An had been a man of any
    occupation if I would not have taken him at a word I would
I
    might go to hell among the rogues And so he fell When he
came
    to himself again he said if he had done or said anything
amiss
    he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity
Three or
    four wenches where I stood cried Alas good soul and
forgave
    him with all their hearts But theres no heed to be taken of
    them if Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have
done
    no less
  BRUTUS And after that he came thus sad away
  CASCA Ay
  CASSIUS Did Cicero say anything
  CASCA Ay he spoke Greek
  CASSIUS To what effect
  CASCA Nay an I tell you that Ill neer look you i the face
    again but those that understood him smiled at one another
and
    shook their heads but for mine own part it was Greek to me
I
    could tell you more news too Marullus and Flavius for
pulling
    scarfs off Caesars images are put to silence Fare you
well
    There was more foolery yet if could remember it
  CASSIUS Will you sup with me tonight Casca
  CASCA No I am promised forth
  CASSIUS Will you dine with me tomorrow
  CASCA Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
worth
    the eating
  CASSIUS Good I will expect you
  CASCA Do so farewell both                            Exit
  BRUTUS What a blunt fellow is this grown to be
    He was quick mettle when he went to school
  CASSIUS So is he now in execution
    Of any bold or noble enterprise
    However he puts on this tardy form
    This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
    Which gives men stomach to digest his words
    With better appetite
  BRUTUS And so it is For this time I will leave you
    Tomorrow if you please to speak with me
    I will come home to you or if you will
    Come home to me and I will wait for you
  CASSIUS I will do so Till then think of the world
                                                    Exit Brutus
    Well Brutus thou art noble yet I see
    Thy honorable mettle may be wrought
    From that it is disposed therefore it is meet
    That noble minds keep ever with their likes
    For who so firm that cannot be seduced
    Caesar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutus
    If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius
    He should not humor me I will this night
    In several hands in at his windows throw
    As if they came from several citizens
    Writings all tending to the great opinion
    That Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
    Caesars ambition shall be glanced at
    And after this let Caesar seat him sure
    For we will shake him or worse days endure           Exit




SCENE III
A street Thunder and lightning

Enter from opposite sides Casca with his sword drawn and
Cicero

  CICERO Good even Casca Brought you Caesar home
    Why are you breathless and why stare you so
  CASCA Are not you moved when all the sway of earth
    Shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero
    I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
    Have rived the knotty oaks and I have seen
    The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
    To be exalted with the threatening clouds
    But never till tonight never till now
    Did I go through a tempest dropping fire
    Either there is a civil strife in heaven
    Or else the world too saucy with the gods
    Incenses them to send destruction
  CICERO Why saw you anything more wonderful
  CASCA A common slave you know him well by sight
    Held up his left hand which did flame and burn
    Like twenty torches joind and yet his hand
    Not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd
    Besides I ha not since put up my sword
    Against the Capitol I met a lion
    Who glazd upon me and went surly by
    Without annoying me And there were drawn
    Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
    Transformed with their fear who swore they saw
    Men all in fire walk up and down the streets
    And yesterday the bird of night did sit
    Even at noonday upon the marketplace
    Howling and shrieking When these prodigies
    Do so conjointly meet let not men say
    These are their reasons they are natural
    For I believe they are portentous things
    Unto the climate that they point upon
  CICERO Indeed it is a strangedisposed time
    But men may construe things after their fashion
    Clean from the purpose of the things themselves
    Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow
  CASCA He doth for he did bid Antonio
    Send word to you he would be there tomorrow
  CICERO Good then Casca This disturbed sky
    Is not to walk in
  CASCA Farewell Cicero                          Exit Cicero

                        Enter Cassius

  CASSIUS Whos there
  CASCA A Roman
  CASSIUS Casca by your voice
  CASCA Your ear is good Cassius what night is this
  CASSIUS A very pleasing night to honest men
  CASCA Who ever knew the heavens menace so
  CASSIUS Those that have known the earth so full of faults
    For my part I have walkd about the streets
    Submitting me unto the perilous night
    And thus unbraced Casca as you see
    Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone
    And when the cross blue lightning seemd to open
    The breast of heaven I did present myself
    Even in the aim and very flash of it
  CASCA But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
    It is the part of men to fear and tremble
    When the most mighty gods by tokens send
    Such dreadful heralds to astonish us
  CASSIUS You are dull Casca and those sparks of life
    That should be in a Roman you do want
    Or else you use not You look pale and gaze
    And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
    To see the strange impatience of the heavens
    But if you would consider the true cause
    Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
    Why birds and beasts from quality and kind
    Why old men fools and children calculate
    Why all these things change from their ordinance
    Their natures and preformed faculties
    To monstrous quality why you shall find
    That heaven hath infused them with these spirits
    To make them instruments of fear and warning
    Unto some monstrous state
    Now could I Casca name to thee a man
    Most like this dreadful night
    That thunders lightens opens graves and roars
    As doth the lion in the Capitol
    A man no mightier than thyself or me
    In personal action yet prodigious grown
    And fearful as these strange eruptions are
  CASCA Tis Caesar that you mean is it not Cassius
  CASSIUS Let it be who it is for Romans now
    Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
    But woe the while Our fathers minds are dead
    And we are governd with our mothers spirits
    Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
  CASCA Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
    Mean to establish Caesar as a king
    And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
    In every place save here in Italy
  CASSIUS I know where I will wear this dagger then
    Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius
    Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
    Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
    Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
    Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
    Can be retentive to the strength of spirit
    But life being weary of these worldly bars
    Never lacks power to dismiss itself
    If I know this know all the world besides
    That part of tyranny that I do bear
    I can shake off at pleasure                  Thunder still
  CASCA So can I
    So every bondman in his own hand bears
    The power to cancel his captivity
  CASSIUS And why should Caesar be a tyrant then
    Poor man I know he would not be a wolf
    But that he sees the Romans are but sheep
    He were no lion were not Romans hinds
    Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
    Begin it with weak straws What trash is Rome
    What rubbish and what offal when it serves
    For the base matter to illuminate
    So vile a thing as Caesar But O grief
    Where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this
    Before a willing bondman then I know
    My answer must be made But I am armd
    And dangers are to me indifferent
  CASCA You speak to Casca and to such a man
    That is no fleering telltale Hold my hand
    Be factious for redress of all these griefs
    And I will set this foot of mine as far
    As who goes farthest
  CASSIUS Theres a bargain made
    Now know you Casca I have moved already
    Some certain of the noblestminded Romans
    To undergo with me an enterprise
    Of honorabledangerous consequence
    And I do know by this they stay for me
    In Pompeys Porch For now this fearful night
    There is no stir or walking in the streets
    And the complexion of the element
    In favors like the work we have in hand
    Most bloody fiery and most terrible

                       Enter Cinna

  CASCA Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
  CASSIUS Tis Cinna I do know him by his gait
    He is a friend Cinna where haste you so
  CINNA To find out you Whos that Metellus Cimber
  CASSIUS No it is Casca one incorporate
    To our attempts Am I not stayd for Cinna
  CINNA I am glad ont What a fearful night is this
    Theres two or three of us have seen strange sights
  CASSIUS Am I not stayd for Tell me
  CINNA Yes you are
    O Cassius if you could
    But win the noble Brutus to our party
  CASSIUS Be you content Good Cinna take this paper
    And look you lay it in the praetors chair
    Where Brutus may but find it and throw this
    In at his window set this up with wax
    Upon old Brutus statue All this done
    Repair to Pompeys Porch where you shall find us
    Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
  CINNA All but Metellus Cimber and hes gone
    To seek you at your house Well I will hie
    And so bestow these papers as you bade me
  CASSIUS That done repair to Pompeys Theatre
                                                     Exit Cinna
    Come Casca you and I will yet ere day
    See Brutus at his house Three parts of him
    Is ours already and the man entire
    Upon the next encounter yields him ours
  CASCA O he sits high in all the peoples hearts
    And that which would appear offense in us
    His countenance like richest alchemy
    Will change to virtue and to worthiness
  CASSIUS Him and his worth and our great need of him
    You have right well conceited Let us go
    For it is after midnight and ere day
    We will awake him and be sure of him                Exeunt

ACT II SCENE I

Enter Brutus in his orchard

  BRUTUS What Lucius ho
    I cannot by the progress of the stars
    Give guess how near to day Lucius I say
    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
    When Lucius when Awake I say What Lucius

                            Enter Lucius

  LUCIUS Calld you my lord
  BRUTUS Get me a taper in my study Lucius
    When it is lighted come and call me here
  LUCIUS I will my lord                                 Exit
  BRUTUS It must be by his death and for my part
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him
    But for the general He would be crownd
    How that might change his nature theres the question
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking Crown him that
    And then I grant we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar
    I have not known when his affections swayd
    More than his reason But tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambitions ladder
    Whereto the climberupward turns his face
    But when he once attains the upmost round
    He then unto the ladder turns his back
    Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend So Caesar may
    Then lest he may prevent And since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is
    Fashion it thus that what he is augmented
    Would run to these and these extremities
    And therefore think him as a serpents egg
    Which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous
    And kill him in the shell

                        Reenter Lucius

  LUCIUS The taper burneth in your closet sir
    Searching the window for a flint I found
    This paper thus seald up and I am sure
    It did not lie there when I went to bed
                                           Gives him the letter
  BRUTUS Get you to bed again it is not day
    Is not tomorrow boy the ides of March
  LUCIUS I know not sir
  BRUTUS Look in the calendar and bring me word
  LUCIUS I will sir                                     Exit
  BRUTUS The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them
                                     Opens the letter and reads
    Brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself
    Shall Rome etc Speak strike redress

    Brutus thou sleepst awake
    Such instigations have been often droppd
    Where I have took them up
    Shall Rome etc Thus must I piece it out
    Shall Rome stand under one mans awe What Rome
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive when he was calld a king
    Speak strike redress Am I entreated
    To speak and strike O Rome I make thee promise
    If the redress will follow thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus

                        Reenter Lucius

  LUCIUS Sir March is wasted fifteen days
                                                Knocking within
  BRUTUS Tis good Go to the gate somebody knocks
                                                    Exit Lucius
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council and the state of man
    Like to a little kingdom suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection

                         Reenter Lucius

  LUCIUS Sir tis your brother Cassius at the door
    Who doth desire to see you
  BRUTUS Is he alone
  LUCIUS No sir there are more with him
  BRUTUS Do you know them
  LUCIUS No sir their hats are pluckd about their ears
    And half their faces buried in their cloaks
    That by no means I may discover them
    By any mark of favor
  BRUTUS Let em enter                            Exit Lucius
    They are the faction O Conspiracy
    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
    When evils are most free O then by day
    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    To mask thy monstrous visage Seek none Conspiracy
    Hide it in smiles and affability
    For if thou path thy native semblance on
    Not Erebus itself were dim enough
    To hide thee from prevention

    Enter the conspirators Cassius Casca Decius Cinna
                Metellus Cimber and Trebonius

  CASSIUS I think we are too bold upon your rest
    Good morrow Brutus do we trouble you
  BRUTUS I have been up this hour awake all night
    Know I these men that come along with you
  CASSIUS Yes every man of them and no man here
    But honors you and every one doth wish
    You had but that opinion of yourself
    Which every noble Roman bears of you
    This is Trebonius
  BRUTUS He is welcome hither
  CASSIUS This Decius Brutus
  BRUTUS He is welcome too
CASSIUS This Casca this Cinna and this Metellus Cimber
  BRUTUS They are all welcome
    What watchful cares do interpose themselves
    Betwixt your eyes and night
  CASSIUS Shall I entreat a word                 They whisper
  DECIUS Here lies the east Doth not the day break here
  CASCA No
  CINNA O pardon sir it doth and yongrey lines
    That fret the clouds are messengers of day
  CASCA You shall confess that you are both deceived
    Here as I point my sword the sun arises
    Which is a great way growing on the south
    Weighing the youthful season of the year
    Some two months hence up higher toward the north
    He first presents his fire and the high east
    Stands as the Capitol directly here
  BRUTUS Give me your hands all over one by one
  CASSIUS And let us swear our resolution
  BRUTUS No not an oath If not the face of men
    The sufferance of our souls the times abuse
    If these be motives weak break off betimes
    And every man hence to his idle bed
    So let highsighted tyranny range on
    Till each man drop by lottery But if these
    As I am sure they do bear fire enough
    To kindle cowards and to steel with valor
    The melting spirits of women then countrymen
    What need we any spur but our own cause
    To prick us to redress What other bond
    Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
    And will not palter And what other oath
    Than honesty to honesty engaged
    That this shall be or we will fall for it
    Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
    Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
    That welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
    Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
    The even virtue of our enterprise
    Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits
    To think that or our cause or our performance
    Did need an oath when every drop of blood
    That every Roman bears and nobly bears
    Is guilty of a several bastardy
    If he do break the smallest particle
    Of any promise that hath passd from him
  CASSIUS But what of Cicero Shall we sound him
    I think he will stand very strong with us
  CASCA Let us not leave him out
  CINNA No by no means
  METELLUS O let us have him for his silver hairs
    Will purchase us a good opinion
    And buy mens voices to commend our deeds
    It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands
    Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
    But all be buried in his gravity
  BRUTUS O name him not let us not break with him
    For he will never follow anything
    That other men begin
  CASSIUS Then leave him out
  CASCA Indeed he is not fit
  DECIUS Shall no man else be touchd but only Caesar
  CASSIUS Decius well urged I think it is not meet
    Mark Antony so well beloved of Caesar
    Should outlive Caesar We shall find of him
    A shrewd contriver and you know his means
    If he improve them may well stretch so far
    As to annoy us all which to prevent
    Let Antony and Caesar fall together
  BRUTUS Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius
    To cut the head off and then hack the limbs
    Like wrath in death and envy afterwards
    For Antony is but a limb of Caesar
    Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
    We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar
    And in the spirit of men there is no blood
    O that we then could come by Caesars spirit
    And not dismember Caesar But alas
    Caesar must bleed for it And gentle friends
    Lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully
    Lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods
    Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
    And let our hearts as subtle masters do
    Stir up their servants to an act of rage
    And after seem to chide em This shall make
    Our purpose necessary and not envious
    Which so appearing to the common eyes
    We shall be calld purgers not murderers
    And for Mark Antony think not of him
    For he can do no more than Caesars arm
    When Caesars head is off
  CASSIUS Yet I fear him
    For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar
  BRUTUS Alas good Cassius do not think of him
    If he love Caesar all that he can do
    Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar
    And that were much he should for he is given
    To sports to wildness and much company
  TREBONIUS There is no fear in himlet him not die
    For he will live and laugh at this hereafter
                                                  Clock strikes
  BRUTUS Peace count the clock
  CASSIUS The clock hath stricken three
  TREBONIUS Tis time to part
  CASSIUS But it is doubtful yet
    Whether Caesar will come forth today or no
    For he is superstitious grown of late
    Quite from the main opinion he held once
    Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
    It may be these apparent prodigies
    The unaccustomd terror of this night
    And the persuasion of his augurers
    May hold him from the Capitol today
  DECIUS Never fear that If he be so resolved
    I can oersway him for he loves to hear
    That unicorns may be betrayd with trees
    And bears with glasses elephants with holes
    Lions with toils and men with flatterers
    But when I tell him he hates flatterers
    He says he does being then most flattered
    Let me work
    For I can give his humor the true bent
    And I will bring him to the Capitol
  CASSIUS Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
  BRUTUS By the eighth hour Is that the utter most
  CINNA Be that the uttermost and fail not then
  METELLUS Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard
    Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey
    I wonder none of you have thought of him
  BRUTUS Now good Metellus go along by him
    He loves me well and I have given him reasons
    Send him but hither and Ill fashion him
  CASSIUS The morning comes upon s Well leave you Brutus
    And friends disperse yourselves but all remember
    What you have said and show yourselves true Romans
  BRUTUS Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
    Let not our looks put on our purposes
    But bear it as our Roman actors do
    With untired spirits and formal constancy
    And so good morrow to you every one
                                          Exeunt all but Brutus
    Boy Lucius Fast asleep It is no matter
    Enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber
    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
    Which busy care draws in the brains of men
    Therefore thou sleepst so sound

                           Enter Portia

  PORTIA Brutus my lord
  BRUTUS Portia what mean you Wherefore rise you now
    It is not for your health thus to commit
    Your weak condition to the raw cold morning
  PORTIA Nor for yours neither have ungently Brutus
    Stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
    You suddenly arose and walkd about
    Musing and sighing with your arms across
    And when I askd you what the matter was
    You stared upon me with ungentle looks
    I urged you further then you scratchd your head
    And too impatiently stampd with your foot
    Yet I insisted yet you answerd not
    But with an angry waiter of your hand
    Gave sign for me to leave you So I did
    Fearing to strengthen that impatience
    Which seemd too much enkindled and withal
    Hoping it was but an effect of humor
    Which sometime hath his hour with every man
    It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
    And could it work so much upon your shape
    As it hath much prevaild on your condition
    I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord
    Make me acquainted with your cause of grief
  BRUTUS I am not well in health and that is all
  PORTIA Brutus is wise and were he not in health
    He would embrace the means to come by it
  BRUTUS Why so I do Good Portia go to bed
  PORTIA Is Brutus sick and is it physical
    To walk unbraced and suck up the humors
    Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick
    And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
    To dare the vile contagion of the night
    And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
    To add unto his sickness No my Brutus
    You have some sick offense within your mind
    Which by the right and virtue of my place
    I ought to know of and upon my knees
    I charm you by my once commended beauty
    By all your vows of love and that great vow
    Which did incorporate and make us one
    That you unfold to me yourself your half
    Why you are heavy and what men tonight
    Have had resort to you for here have been
    Some six or seven who did hide their faces
    Even from darkness
  BRUTUS Kneel not gentle Portia
  PORTIA I should not need if you were gentle Brutus
    Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus
    Is it excepted I should know no secrets
    That appertain to you Am I yourself
    But as it were in sort or limitation
    To keep with you at meals comfort your bed
    And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs
    Of your good pleasure If it be no more
    Portia is Brutus harlot not his wife
  BRUTUS You are my true and honorable wife
    As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
    That visit my sad heart
  PORTIA If this were true then should I know this secret
    I grant I am a woman but withal
    A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife
    I grant I am a woman but withal
    A woman well reputed Catos daughter
    Think you I am no stronger than my sex
    Being so fatherd and so husbanded
    Tell me your counsels I will not disclose em
    I have made strong proof of my constancy
    Giving myself a voluntary wound
    Here in the thigh Can I bear that with patience
    And not my husbands secrets
  BRUTUS O ye gods
    Render me worthy of this noble wife Knocking within
    Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart
    All my engagements I will construe to thee
    All the charactery of my sad brows
    Leave me with haste Exit Portia Lucius whos that
knocks

                  Reenter Lucius with Ligarius

  LUCIUS Here is a sick man that would speak with you
  BRUTUS Caius Ligarius that Metellus spake of
    Boy stand aside Caius Ligarius how
  LIGARIUS Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
  BRUTUS O what a time have you chose out brave Caius
    To wear a kerchief Would you were not sick
  LIGARIUS I am not sick if Brutus have in hand
    Any exploit worthy the name of honor
  BRUTUS Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius
    Had you a healthful ear to hear of it
  LIGARIUS By all the gods that Romans bow before
    I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome
    Brave son derived from honorable loins
    Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
    My mortified spirit Now bid me run
    And I will strive with things impossible
    Yea get the better of them Whats to do
  BRUTUS A piece of work that will make sick men whole
  LIGARIUS But are not some whole that we must make sick
  BRUTUS That must we also What it is my Caius
    I shall unfold to thee as we are going
    To whom it must be done
  LIGARIUS Set on your foot
    And with a heart newfired I follow you
    To do I know not what but it sufficeth
    That Brutus leads me on
  BRUTUS Follow me then                                Exeunt




SCENE II
Caesars house Thunder and lightning

Enter Caesar in his nightgown

  CAESAR Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
    Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out
    Help ho They murther Caesar Whos within

                         Enter a Servant

  SERVANT My lord
  CAESAR Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
    And bring me their opinions of success
  SERVANT I will my lord                                Exit

                         Enter Calpurnia

  CALPURNIA What mean you Caesar Think you to walk forth
    You shall not stir out of your house today
  CAESAR Caesar shall forth the things that threatend me
    Neer lookd but on my back when they shall see
    The face of Caesar they are vanished
  CALPURNIA Caesar I I stood on ceremonies
    Yet now they fright me There is one within
    Besides the things that we have heard and seen
    Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
    A lioness hath whelped in the streets
    And graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead
    Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds
    In ranks and squadrons and right form of war
    Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol
    The noise of battle hurtled in the air
    Horses did neigh and dying men did groan
    And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
    O Caesar These things are beyond all use
    And I do fear them
  CAESAR What can be avoided
    Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
    Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions
    Are to the world in general as to Caesar
  CALPURNIA When beggars die there are no comets seen
    The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
  CAESAR Cowards die many times before their deaths
    The valiant never taste of death but once
    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear
    Seeing that death a necessary end
    Will come when it will come

                      Reenter Servant

    What say the augurers
  SERVANT They would not have you to stir forth today
    Plucking the entrails of an offering forth
    They could not find a heart within the beast
  CAESAR The gods do this in shame of cowardice
    Caesar should be a beast without a heart
    If he should stay at home today for fear
    No Caesar shall not Danger knows full well
    That Caesar is more dangerous than he
    We are two lions litterd in one day
    And I the elder and more terrible
    And Caesar shall go forth
  CALPURNIA Alas my lord
    Your wisdom is consumed in confidence
    Do not go forth today Call it my fear
    That keeps you in the house and not your own
    Well send Mark Antony to the Senate House
    And he shall say you are not well today
    Let me upon my knee prevail in this
  CAESAR Mark Antony shall say I am not well
    And for thy humor I will stay at home

                        Enter Decius

    Heres Decius Brutus he shall tell them so
  DECIUS Caesar all hail Good morrow worthy Caesar
    I come to fetch you to the Senate House
  CAESAR And you are come in very happy time
    To bear my greeting to the senators
    And tell them that I will not come today
    Cannot is false and that I dare not falser
    I will not come today Tell them so Decius
  CALPURNIA Say he is sick
  CAESAR Shall Caesar send a lie
    Have I in conquest stretchd mine arm so far
    To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth
    Decius go tell them Caesar will not come
  DECIUS Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause
    Lest I be laughd at when I tell them so
  CAESAR The cause is in my will I will not come
    That is enough to satisfy the Senate
    But for your private satisfaction
    Because I love you I will let you know
    Calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
    She dreamt tonight she saw my statue
    Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
    Did run pure blood and many lusty Romans
    Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
    And these does she apply for warnings and portents
    And evils imminent and on her knee
    Hath beggd that I will stay at home today
  DECIUS This dream is all amiss interpreted
    It was a vision fair and fortunate
    Your statue spouting blood in many pipes
    In which so many smiling Romans bathed
    Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
    Reviving blood and that great men shall press
    For tinctures stains relics and cognizance
    This by Calpurnias dream is signified
  CAESAR And this way have you well expounded it
  DECIUS I have when you have heard what I can say
    And know it now the Senate have concluded
    To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar
    If you shall send them word you will not come
    Their minds may change Besides it were a mock
    Apt to be renderd for someone to say
    Break up the Senate till another time
    When Caesars wife shall meet with better dreams
    If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
    Lo Caesar is afraid
    Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love
    To your proceeding bids me tell you this
    And reason to my love is liable
  CAESAR How foolish do your fears seem now Calpurnia
    I am ashamed I did yield to them
    Give me my robe for I will go

         Enter Publius Brutus Ligarius Metellus Casca
                     Trebonius and Cinna

    And look where Publius is come to fetch me
  PUBLIUS Good morrowCaesar
  CAESAR Welcome Publius

    Good morrow Casca Caius Ligarius
    Caesar was neer so much your enemy
    As that same ague which hath made you lean

  BRUTUS Caesar tis strucken eight
  CAESAR I thank you for your pains and courtesy

                           Enter Antony

    See Antony that revels long o nights
    Is notwithstanding up Good morrow Antony
  ANTONY So to most noble Caesar
  CAESAR Bid them prepare within
    I am to blame to be thus waited for
    Now Cinna now Metellus what Trebonius
    I have an hours talk in store for you
    Remember that you call on me today
    Be near me that I may remember you
  TREBONIUS Caesar I will Aside And so near will I be
    That your best friends shall wish I had been further
  CAESAR Good friends go in and taste some wine with me
    And we like friends will straightway go together
  BRUTUS Aside That every like is not the same O Caesar
    The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon            Exeunt

    Here will I stand till Caesar pass along
    And as a suitor will I give him this
    My heart laments that virtue cannot live
    Out of the teeth of emulation
    If thou read this O Caesar thou mayest live
    If not the Fates with traitors do contrive           Exit

  SOOTHSAYER None that I know will be much that I fear may
chance
    Good morrow to you Here the street is narrow
    The throng that follows Caesar at the heels
    Of senators of praetors common suitors
    Will crowd a feeble man almost to death
    Ill get me to a place more void and there
    Speak to great Caesar as he comes along               Exit
  PORTIA I must go in Ay me how weak a thing
    The heart of woman is O Brutus

  DECIUS Trebonius doth desire you to oer read
    At your best leisure this his humble suit

  CASSIUS What urge you your petitions in the street
    Come to the Capitol

      Caesar goes up to the Senate House the rest follow

  POPILIUS I wish your enterprise today may thrive
  CASSIUS What enterprise Popilius
  POPILIUS Fare you well
                                             Advances to Caesar
  BRUTUS What said Popilius Lena
  CASSIUS He wishd today our enterprise might thrive
    I fear our purpose is discovered
  BRUTUS Look how he makes to Caesar Mark him
  CASSIUS Casca
    Be sudden for we fear prevention
    Brutus what shall be done If this be known
    Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back
    For I will slay myself
  BRUTUS Cassius be constant
    Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes
    For look he smiles and Caesar doth not change
  CASSIUS Trebonius knows his time for look you Brutus
    He draws Mark Antony out of the way
                                    Exeunt Antony and Trebonius
  DECIUS Where is Metellus Cimber Let him
    And presently prefer his suit to Caesar
  BRUTUS He is addressd press near and second him
  CINNA Casca you are the first that rears your hand
  CAESAR Are we all ready What is now amiss
    That Caesar and his Senate must redress
  METELLUS Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar
    Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
    An humble heart                                     Kneels
  CAESAR I must prevent thee Cimber
    These couchings and these lowly courtesies
    Might fire the blood of ordinary men
    And turn preordinance and first decree
    Into the law of children Be not fond
    To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
    That will be thawd from the true quality
    With that which melteth fools I mean sweet words
    Lowcrooked courtsies and base spanielfawning
    Thy brother by decree is banished
    If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
    I spurn thee like a cur out of my way
    Know Caesar doth not wrong nor without cause
    Will he be satisfied
  METELLUS Is there no voice more worthy than my own
    To sound more sweetly in great Caesars ear
    For the repealing of my banishd brother
  BRUTUS I kiss thy hand but not in flattery Caesar
    Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
    Have an immediate freedom of repeal
  CAESAR What Brutus
  CASSIUS Pardon Caesar Caesar pardon
    As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall
    To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber
  CAESAR I could be well moved if I were as you
    If I could pray to move prayers would move me
    But I am constant as the northern star
    Of whose truefixd and resting quality
    There is no fellow in the firmament
    The skies are painted with unnumberd sparks
    They are all fire and every one doth shine
    But theres but one in all doth hold his place
    So in the world tis furnishd well with men
    And men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
    Yet in the number I do know but one
    That unassailable holds on his rank
    Unshaked of motion and that I am he
    Let me a little show it even in this
    That I was constant Cimber should be banishd
    And constant do remain to keep him so
  CINNA O Caesar
  CAESAR Hence Wilt thou lift up Olympus
  DECIUS Great Caesar
  CAESAR Doth not Brutus bootless kneel
  CASCA Speak hands for me
                        Casca first then the other Conspirators
                                  and Marcus Brutus stab Caesar
  CAESAR Et tu Brute Then fall Caesar Dies
  CINNA Liberty Freedom Tyranny is dead
    Run hence proclaim cry it about the streets
  CASSIUS Some to the common pulpits and cry out
    Liberty freedom and enfranchisement
  BRUTUS People and senators be not affrighted
    Fly not stand still ambitions debt is paid
  CASCA Go to the pulpit Brutus
  DECIUS And Cassius too
  BRUTUS Wheres Publius
  CINNA Here quite confounded with this mutiny
  METELLUS Stand fast together lest some friend of Caesars
    Should chance
  BRUTUS Talk not of standing Publius good cheer
    There is no harm intended to your person
    Nor to no Roman else So tell them Publius
  CASSIUS And leave us Publius lest that the people
    Rushing on us should do your age some mischief
  BRUTUS Do so and let no man abide this deed
    But we the doers

                        Reenter Trebonius

  CASSIUS Where is Antony
  TREBONIUS Fled to his house amazed
    Men wives and children stare cry out and run
    As it were doomsday
  BRUTUS Fates we will know your pleasures
    That we shall die we know tis but the time
    And drawing days out that men stand upon
  CASSIUS Why he that cuts off twenty years of life
    Cuts off so many years of fearing death
  BRUTUS Grant that and then is death a benefit
    So are we Caesars friends that have abridged
    His time of fearing death Stoop Romans stoop
    And let us bathe our hands in Caesars blood
    Up to the elbows and besmear our swords
    Then walk we forth even to the marketplace
    And waving our red weapons oer our heads
    Lets all cry Peace freedom and liberty
  CASSIUS Stoop then and wash How many ages hence
    Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
    In states unborn and accents yet unknown
  BRUTUS How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport
    That now on Pompeys basis lies along
    No worthier than the dust
  CASSIUS So oft as that shall be
    So often shall the knot of us be calld
    The men that gave their country liberty
  DECIUS What shall we forth
  CASSIUS Ay every man away
    Brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels
    With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome

                        Enter a Servant

  BRUTUS Soft who comes here A friend of Antonys
  SERVANT Thus Brutus did my master bid me kneel
    Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down
    And being prostrate thus he bade me say
    Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
    Caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
    Say I love Brutus and I honor him
    Say I feard Caesar honord him and loved him
    If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
    May safely come to him and be resolved
    How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death
    Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
    So well as Brutus living but will follow
    The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
    Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
    With all true faith So says my master Antony
  BRUTUS Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman
    I never thought him worse
    Tell him so please him come unto this place
    He shall be satisfied and by my honor
    Depart untouchd
  SERVANT Ill fetch him presently                       Exit
  BRUTUS I know that we shall have him well to friend
  CASSIUS I wish we may but yet have I a mind
    That fears him much and my misgiving still
    Falls shrewdly to the purpose

                          Reenter Antony

  BRUTUS But here comes Antony Welcome Mark Antony
  ANTONY O mighty Caesar Dost thou lie so low
    Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
    Shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well
    I know not gentlemen what you intend
    Who else must be let blood who else is rank
    If I myself there is no hour so fit
    As Caesars deaths hour nor no instrument
    Of half that worth as those your swords made rich
    With the most noble blood of all this world
    I do beseech ye if you bear me hard
    Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
    Fulfill your pleasure Live a thousand years
    I shall not find myself so apt to die
    No place will please me so no means of death
    As here by Caesar and by you cut off
    The choice and master spirits of this age
  BRUTUS O Antony beg not your death of us
    Though now we must appear bloody and cruel
    As by our hands and this our present act
    You see we do yet see you but our hands
    And this the bleeding business they have done
    Our hearts you see not they are pitiful
    And pity to the general wrong of Rome
    As fire drives out fire so pity pity
    Hath done this deed on Caesar For your part
    To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony
    Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
    Of brothers temper do receive you in
    With all kind love good thoughts and reverence
  CASSIUS Your voice shall be as strong as any mans
    In the disposing of new dignities
  BRUTUS Only be patient till we have appeased
    The multitude beside themselves with fear
    And then we will deliver you the cause
    Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him
    Have thus proceeded
  ANTONY I doubt not of your wisdom
    Let each man render me his bloody hand
    First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you
    Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand
    Now Decius Brutus yours now yours Metellus
    Yours Cinna and my valiant Casca yours
    Though last not least in love yours good Trebonius
    Gentlemen all alas what shall I say
    My credit now stands on such slippery ground
    That one of two bad ways you must conceit me
    Either a coward or a flatterer
    That I did love thee Caesar O tis true
    If then thy spirit look upon us now
    Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
    To see thy Antony making his peace
    Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
    Most noble In the presence of thy corse
    Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds
    Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
    It would become me better than to close
    In terms of friendship with thine enemies
    Pardon me Julius Here wast thou bayd brave hart
    Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
    Signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy Lethe
    O world thou wast the forest to this hart
    And this indeed O world the heart of thee
    How like a deer strucken by many princes
    Dost thou here lie
  CASSIUS Mark Antony
  ANTONY Pardon me Caius Cassius
    The enemies of Caesar shall say this
    Then in a friend it is cold modesty
  CASSIUS I blame you not for praising Caesar so
    But what compact mean you to have with us
    Will you be prickd in number of our friends
    Or shall we on and not depend on you
  ANTONY Therefore I took your hands but was indeed
    Swayd from the point by looking down on Caesar
    Friends am I with you all and love you all
    Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
    Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous
  BRUTUS Or else were this a savage spectacle
    Our reasons are so full of good regard
    That were you Antony the son of Caesar
    You should be satisfied
  ANTONY Thats all I seek
    And am moreover suitor that I may
    Produce his body to the marketplace
    And in the pulpit as becomes a friend
    Speak in the order of his funeral
  BRUTUS You shall Mark Antony
  CASSIUS Brutus a word with you
    Aside to Brutus You know not what you do Do not consent
    That Antony speak in his funeral
    Know you how much the people may be moved
    By that which he will utter
  BRUTUS By your pardon
    I will myself into the pulpit first
    And show the reason of our Caesars death
    What Antony shall speak I will protest
    He speaks by leave and by permission
    And that we are contented Caesar shall
    Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
    It shall advantage more than do us wrong
  CASSIUS I know not what may fall I like it not
  BRUTUS Mark Antony here take you Caesars body
    You shall not in your funeral speech blame us
    But speak all good you can devise of Caesar
    And say you dot by our permission
    Else shall you not have any hand at all
    About his funeral And you shall speak
    In the same pulpit whereto I am going
    After my speech is ended
  ANTONY Be it so
    I do desire no more
  BRUTUS Prepare the body then and follow us
                                          Exeunt all but Antony
  ANTONY O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times
    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
    Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
    Blood and destruction shall be so in use
    And dreadful objects so familiar
    That mothers shall but smile when they behold
    Their infants quarterd with the hands of war
    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds
    And Caesars spirit ranging for revenge
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell
    Shall in these confines with a monarchs voice
    Cry Havoc and let slip the dogs of war
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    With carrion men groaning for burial

                        Enter a Servant

    You serve Octavius Caesar do you not
  SERVANT I do Mark Antony
  ANTONY Caesar did write for him to come to Rome
  SERVANT He did receive his letters and is coming
    And bid me say to you by word of mouth
    O Caesar                                     Sees the body
  ANTONY Thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
    Passion I see is catching for mine eyes
    Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine
    Began to water Is thy master coming
  SERVANT He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome
  ANTONY Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
    Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome
    No Rome of safety for Octavius yet
    Hie hence and tell him so Yet stay awhile
    Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
    Into the marketplace There shall I try
    In my oration how the people take
    The cruel issue of these bloody men
    According to the which thou shalt discourse
    To young Octavius of the state of things
    Lend me your hand                Exeunt with Caesars body




SCENE II
The Forum

Enter Brutus and Cassius and a throng of Citizens

  CITIZENS We will be satisfied Let us be satisfied
  BRUTUS Then follow me and give me audience friends
    Cassius go you into the other street
    And part the numbers
    Those that will hear me speak let em stay here
    Those that will follow Cassius go with him
    And public reasons shall be rendered
    Of Caesars death
  FIRST CITIZEN I will hear Brutus speak
  SECOND CITIZEN I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons
    When severally we hear them rendered
                               Exit Cassius with some Citizens
                                    Brutus goes into the pulpit
  THIRD CITIZEN The noble Brutus is ascended Silence
  BRUTUS Be patient till the last
    Romans countrymen and lovers Hear me for my cause and be
    silent that you may hear Believe me for mine honor and
have
    respect to mine honor that you may believe Censure me in
your
    wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge
If
    there be any in this assembly any dear friend of Caesars
to
    him I say that Brutus love to Caesar was no less than his
If
    then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this
is
    my answer Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved
Rome
    more Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves
than
    that Caesar were dead to live all freemen As Caesar loved
me I
    weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was
    valiant I honor him but as he was ambitious I slew him
There
    is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his
valor
    and death for his ambition Who is here so base that would be
a
    bondman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here
so
    rude that would not be a Roman If any speak for him have I
    offended Who is here so vile that will not love his country
If
    any speak for him have I offended I pause for a reply
  ALL None Brutus none
  BRUTUS Then none have I offended I have done no more to
Caesar
    than you shall do to Brutus The question of his death is
    enrolled in the Capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he
was
    worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered
death

              Enter Antony and others with Caesars body

    Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who though he
had
    no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying
a
    place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not With
this I
    depart that as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome I
    have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my
country
    to need my death
  ALL Live Brutus live live
  FIRST CITIZEN Bring him with triumph home unto his house
  SECOND CITIZEN Give him a statue with his ancestors
  THIRD CITIZEN Let him be Caesar
  FOURTH CITIZEN Caesars better parts
    Shall be crownd in Brutus
  FIRST CITIZEN Well bring him to his house with shouts and
    clamors
  BRUTUS My countrymen
  SECOND CITIZEN Peace Silence Brutus speaks
  FIRST CITIZEN Peace ho
  BRUTUS Good countrymen let me depart alone
    And for my sake stay here with Antony
    Do grace to Caesars corse and grace his speech
    Tending to Caesars glories which Mark Antony
    By our permission is allowd to make
    I do entreat you not a man depart
    Save I alone till Antony have spoke                  Exit
  FIRST CITIZEN Stay ho and let us hear Mark Antony
  THIRD CITIZEN Let him go up into the public chair
    Well hear him Noble Antony go up
  ANTONY For Brutus sake I am beholding to you
                                           Goes into the pulpit
  FOURTH CITIZEN What does he say of Brutus
  THIRD CITIZEN He says for Brutus sake
    He finds himself beholding to us all
  FOURTH CITIZEN Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here
  FIRST CITIZEN This Caesar was a tyrant
  THIRD CITIZEN Nay thats certain
    We are blest that Rome is rid of him
  SECOND CITIZEN Peace Let us hear what Antony can say
  ANTONY You gentle Romans
  ALL Peace ho Let us hear him
  ANTONY Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears
    I come to bury Caesar not to praise him
    The evil that men do lives after them
    The good is oft interred with their bones
    So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus
    Hath told you Caesar was ambitious
    If it were so it was a grievous fault
    And grievously hath Caesar answerd it
    Here under leave of Brutus and the rest
    For Brutus is an honorable man
    So are they all all honorable men
    Come I to speak in Caesars funeral
    He was my friend faithful and just to me
    But Brutus says he was ambitious
    And Brutus is an honorable man
    He hath brought many captives home to Rome
    Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
    Did this in Caesar seem ambitious
    When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept
    Ambition should be made of sterner stuff
    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
    And Brutus is an honorable man
    You all did see that on the Lupercal
    I thrice presented him a kingly crown
    Which he did thrice refuse Was this ambition
    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
    And sure he is an honorable man
    I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke
    But here I am to speak what I do know
    You all did love him once not without cause
    What cause withholds you then to mourn for him
    O judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts
    And men have lost their reason Bear with me
    My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar
    And I must pause till it come back to me
  FIRST CITIZEN Methinks there is much reason in his sayings
  SECOND CITIZEN If thou consider rightly of the matter
    Caesar has had great wrong
  THIRD CITIZEN Has he masters
    I fear there will a worse come in his place
  FOURTH CITIZEN Markd ye his words He would not take the
crown
    Therefore tis certain he was not ambitious
  FIRST CITIZEN If it be found so some will dear abide it
  SECOND CITIZEN Poor soul his eyes are red as fire with
weeping
  THIRD CITIZEN Theres not a nobler man in Rome than Antony
  FOURTH CITIZEN Now mark him he begins again to speak
  ANTONY But yesterday the word of Caesar might
    Have stood against the world Now lies he there
    And none so poor to do him reverence
    O masters If I were disposed to stir
    Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
    I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong
    Who you all know are honorable men
    I will not do them wrong I rather choose
    To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
    Than I will wrong such honorable men
    But heres a parchment with the seal of Caesar
    I found it in his closet tis his will
    Let but the commons hear this testament
    Which pardon me I do not mean to read
    And they would go and kiss dead Caesars wounds
    And dip their napkins in his sacred blood
    Yea beg a hair of him for memory
    And dying mention it within their wills
    Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
    Unto their issue
  FOURTH CITIZEN Well hear the will Read it Mark Antony
  ALL The will the will We will hear Caesars will
  ANTONY Have patience gentle friends I must not read it
    It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you
    You are not wood you are not stones but men
    And being men hearing the will of Caesar
    It will inflame you it will make you mad
    Tis good you know not that you are his heirs
    For if you should O what would come of it
  FOURTH CITIZEN Read the will well hear it Antony
    You shall read us the will Caesars will
  ANTONY Will you be patient Will you stay awhile
    I have oershot myself to tell you of it
    I fear I wrong the honorable men
    Whose daggers have stabbd Caesar I do fear it
  FOURTH CITIZEN They were traitors Honorable men
  ALL The will The testament
  SECOND CITIZEN They were villains murtherers The will
    Read the will
  ANTONY You will compel me then to read the will
    Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar
    And let me show you him that made the will
    Shall I descend And will you give me leave
  ALL Come down
  SECOND CITIZEN Descend
                                  He comes down from the pulpit
  THIRD CITIZEN You shall have leave
  FOURTH CITIZEN A ring stand round
  FIRST CITIZEN Stand from the hearse stand from the body
  SECOND CITIZEN Room for Antony most noble Antony
  ANTONY Nay press not so upon me stand far off
  ALL Stand back room bear back
  ANTONY If you have tears prepare to shed them now
    You all do know this mantle I remember
    The first time ever Caesar put it on
    Twas on a summers evening in his tent
    That day he overcame the Nervii
    Look in this place ran Cassius dagger through
    See what a rent the envious Casca made
    Through this the wellbeloved Brutus stabbd
    And as he pluckd his cursed steel away
    Mark how the blood of Caesar followd it
    As rushing out of doors to be resolved
    If Brutus so unkindly knockd or no
    For Brutus as you know was Caesars angel
    Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him
    This was the most unkindest cut of all
    For when the noble Caesar saw him stab
    Ingratitude more strong than traitors arms
    Quite vanquishd him Then burst his mighty heart
    And in his mantle muffling up his face
    Even at the base of Pompeys statue
    Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell
    O what a fall was there my countrymen
    Then I and you and all of us fell down
    Whilst bloody treason flourishd over us
    O now you weep and I perceive you feel
    The dint of pity These are gracious drops
    Kind souls what weep you when you but behold
    Our Caesars vesture wounded Look you here
    Here is himself marrd as you see with traitors
  FIRST CITIZEN O piteous spectacle
  SECOND CITIZEN O noble Caesar
  THIRD CITIZEN O woeful day
  FOURTH CITIZEN O traitors villains
  FIRST CITIZEN O most bloody sight
  SECOND CITIZEN We will be revenged
  ALL Revenge About Seek Burn Fire Kill
    Slay Let not a traitor live
  ANTONY Stay countrymen
  FIRST CITIZEN Peace there Hear the noble Antony
  SECOND CITIZEN Well hear him well follow him well die
with
    him
  ANTONY Good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
    To such a sudden flood of mutiny
    They that have done this deed are honorable
    What private griefs they have alas I know not
    That made them do it They are wise and honorable
    And will no doubt with reasons answer you
    I come not friends to steal away your hearts
    I am no orator as Brutus is
    But as you know me all a plain blunt man
    That love my friend and that they know full well
    That gave me public leave to speak of him
    For I have neither wit nor words nor worth
    Action nor utterance nor the power of speech
    To stir mens blood I only speak right on
    I tell you that which you yourselves do know
    Show you sweet Caesars wounds poor dumb mouths
    And bid them speak for me But were I Brutus
    And Brutus Antony there were an Antony
    Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
    In every wound of Caesar that should move
    The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny
  ALL Well mutiny
  FIRST CITIZEN Well burn the house of Brutus
  THIRD CITIZEN Away then Come seek the conspirators
  ANTONY Yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak

    Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves
    Alas you know not I must tell you then
    You have forgot the will I told you of
  ALL Most true the will Lets stay and hear the will
  ANTONY Here is the will and under Caesars seal
    To every Roman citizen he gives
    To every several man seventyfive drachmas
  SECOND CITIZEN Most noble Caesar Well revenge his death
  THIRD CITIZEN O royal Caesar
  ANTONY Hear me with patience
  ALL Peace ho
  ANTONY Moreover he hath left you all his walks
    His private arbors and newplanted orchards
    On this side Tiber he hath left them you
    And to your heirs forever common pleasures
    To walk abroad and recreate yourselves
    Here was a Caesar When comes such another
  FIRST CITIZEN Never never Come away away
    Well burn his body in the holy place
    And with the brands fire the traitors houses
    Take up the body
  SECOND CITIZEN Go fetch fire

ACT IV SCENE I
A house in Rome Antony Octavius and Lepidus seated at a
table

  ANTONY These many then shall die their names are prickd
  OCTAVIUS Your brother too must die consent you Lepidus
  LEPIDUS I do consent
  OCTAVIUS Prick him down Antony
  LEPIDUS Upon condition Publius shall not live
    Who is your sisters son Mark Antony
  ANTONY He shall not live look with a spot I damn him
    But Lepidus go you to Caesars house
    Fetch the will hither and we shall determine
    How to cut off some charge in legacies
  LEPIDUS What shall I find you here
  OCTAVIUS Or here or at the Capitol            Exit Lepidus
  ANTONY This is a slight unmeritable man
    Meet to be sent on errands Is it fit
    The threefold world divided he should stand
    One of the three to share it
  OCTAVIUS So you thought him
    And took his voice who should be prickd to die
    In our black sentence and proscription
  ANTONY Octavius I have seen more days than you
    And though we lay these honors on this man
    To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
    He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
    To groan and sweat under the business
    Either led or driven as we point the way
    And having brought our treasure where we will
    Then take we down his load and turn him off
    Like to the empty ass to shake his ears
    And graze in commons
  OCTAVIUS You may do your will
    But hes a tried and valiant soldier
  ANTONY So is my horse Octavius and for that
    I do appoint him store of provender
    It is a creature that I teach to fight
    To wind to stop to run directly on
    His corporal motion governd by my spirit
    And in some taste is Lepidus but so
    He must be taught and traind and bid go forth
    A barrenspirited fellow one that feeds
    On objects arts and imitations
    Which out of use and staled by other men
    Begin his fashion Do not talk of him
    But as a property And now Octavius
    Listen great things Brutus and Cassius
    Are levying powers we must straight make head
    Therefore let our alliance be combined
    Our best friends made our means stretchd
    And let us presently go sit in council
    How covert matters may be best disclosed
    And open perils surest answered
  OCTAVIUS Let us do so for we are at the stake
    And bayd about with many enemies
    And some that smile have in their hearts I fear
    Millions of mischiefs                               Exeunt




SCENE II
Camp near Sardis Before Brutus tent Drum

Enter Brutus Lucilius Lucius and Soldiers Titinius and
Pindarus meet them

  BRUTUS Stand ho
  LUCILIUS Give the word ho and stand
  BRUTUS What now Lucilius is Cassius near
  LUCILIUS He is at hand and Pindarus is come
    To do you salutation from his master
  BRUTUS He greets me well Your master Pindarus
    In his own change or by ill officers
    Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
    Things done undone but if he be at hand
    I shall be satisfied
  PINDARUS I do not doubt
    But that my noble master will appear
    Such as he is full of regard and honor
  BRUTUS He is not doubted A word Lucilius
    How he received you Let me be resolved
  LUCILIUS With courtesy and with respect enough
    But not with such familiar instances
    Nor with such free and friendly conference
    As he hath used of old
  BRUTUS Thou hast described
    A hot friend cooling Ever note Lucilius
    When love begins to sicken and decay
    It useth an enforced ceremony
    There are no tricks in plain and simple faith
    But hollow men like horses hot at hand
    Make gallant show and promise of their mettle
    But when they should endure the bloody spur
    They fall their crests and like deceitful jades
    Sink in the trial Comes his army on
  LUCILIUS They meant his night in Sard is to be quarterd
    The greater part the horse in general
    Are come with Cassius                     Low march within
  BRUTUS Hark he is arrived

  CASSIUS Stand ho

  FIRST SOLDIER Stand
  SECOND SOLDIER Stand
  THIRD SOLDIER Stand
  CASSIUS Most noble brother you have done me wrong
  BRUTUS Judge me you gods Wrong I mine enemies
    And if not so how should I wrong a brother
  CASSIUS Brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
    And when you do them
  BRUTUS Cassius be content
    Speak your griefs softly I do know you well
    Before the eyes of both our armies here
    Which should perceive nothing but love from us
    Let us not wrangle Bid them move away
    Then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs
    And I will give you audience
  CASSIUS Pindarus

    A little from this ground
  BRUTUS Lucilius do you the like and let no man
    Come to our tent till we have done our conference
    Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door             Exeunt




SCENE III
Brutus tent

Enter Brutus and Cassius

  CASSIUS That you have wrongd me doth appear in this
    You have condemnd and noted Lucius Pella
    For taking bribes here of the Sardians
    Wherein my letters praying on his side
    Because I knew the man were slighted off
  BRUTUS You wrongd yourself to write in such a case
  CASSIUS In such a time as this it is not meet
    That every nice offense should bear his comment
  BRUTUS Let me tell you Cassius you yourself
    Are much condemnd to have an itching palm
    To sell and mart your offices for gold
    To undeservers
  CASSIUS I an itching palm
    You know that you are Brutus that speaks this
    Or by the gods this speech were else your last
  BRUTUS The name of Cassius honors this corruption
    And chastisement doth therefore hide his head
  CASSIUS Chastisement
  BRUTUS Remember March the ides of March remember
    Did not great Julius bleed for justice sake
    What villain touchd his body that did stab
    And not for justice What shall one of us
    That struck the foremost man of all this world
    But for supporting robbers shall we now
    Contaminate our fingers with base bribes
    And sell the mighty space of our large honors
    For so much trash as may be grasped thus
    I had rather be a dog and bay the moon
    Than such a Roman
  CASSIUS Brutus bait not me
    Ill not endure it You forget yourself
    To hedge me in I am a soldier I
    Older in practice abler than yourself
    To make conditions
  BRUTUS Go to you are not Cassius
  CASSIUS I am
  BRUTUS I say you are not
  CASSIUS Urge me no more I shall forget myself
    Have mind upon your health tempt me no farther
  BRUTUS Away slight man
  CASSIUS Ist possible
  BRUTUS Hear me for I will speak
    Must I give way and room to your rash choler
    Shall I be frighted when a madman stares
  CASSIUS O gods ye gods Must I endure all this
  BRUTUS All this Ay more Fret till your proud heart break
    Go show your slaves how choleric you are
    And make your bondmen tremble Must I bouge
    Must I observe you Must I stand and crouch
    Under your testy humor By the gods
    You shall digest the venom of your spleen
    Though it do split you for from this day forth
    Ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
    When you are waspish
  CASSIUS Is it come to this
  BRUTUS You say you are a better soldier
    Let it appear so make your vaunting true
    And it shall please me well For mine own part
    I shall be glad to learn of noble men
  CASSIUS You wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus
    I said an elder soldier not a better
    Did I say better
  BRUTUS If you did I care not
  CASSIUS When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
  BRUTUS Peace peace You durst not so have tempted him
  CASSIUS I durst not
  BRUTUS No
  CASSIUS What durst not tempt him
  BRUTUS For your life you durst not
  CASSIUS Do not presume too much upon my love
    I may do that I shall be sorry for
  BRUTUS You have done that you should be sorry for
    There is no terror Cassius in your threats
    For I am armd so strong in honesty
    That they pass by me as the idle wind
    Which I respect not I did send to you
    For certain sums of gold which you denied me
    For I can raise no money by vile means
    By heaven I had rather coin my heart
    And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
    From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
    By any indirection I did send
    To you for gold to pay my legions
    Which you denied me Was that done like Cassius
    Should I have answerd Caius Cassius so
    When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
    To lock such rascal counters from his friends
    Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
    Dash him to pieces
  CASSIUS I denied you not
  BRUTUS You did
  CASSIUS I did not He was but a fool
    That brought my answer back Brutus hath rived my heart
    A friend should bear his friends infirmities
    But Brutus makes mine greater than they are
  BRUTUS I do not till you practise them on me
  CASSIUS You love me not
  BRUTUS I do not like your faults
  CASSIUS A friendly eye could never see such faults
  BRUTUS A flatterers would not though they do appear
    As huge as high Olympus
  CASSIUS Come Antony and young Octavius come
    Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius
    For Cassius is aweary of the world
    Hated by one he loves braved by his brother
    Checkd like a bondman all his faults observed
    Set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote
    To cast into my teeth O I could weep
    My spirit from mine eyes There is my dagger
    And here my naked breast within a heart
    Dearer than Plutos mine richer than gold
    If that thou best a Roman take it forth
    I that denied thee gold will give my heart
    Strike as thou didst at Caesar for I know
    When thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
    Than ever thou lovedst Cassius
  BRUTUS Sheathe your dagger
    Be angry when you will it shall have scope
    Do what you will dishonor shall be humor
    O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb
    That carries anger as the flint bears fire
    Who much enforced shows a hasty spark
    And straight is cold again
  CASSIUS Hath Cassius lived
    To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus
    When grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him
  BRUTUS When I spoke that I was illtemperd too
  CASSIUS Do you confess so much Give me your hand
  BRUTUS And my heart too
  CASSIUS O Brutus
  BRUTUS Whats the matter
  CASSIUS Have not you love enough to bear with me
    When that rash humor which my mother gave me
    Makes me forgetful
  BRUTUS Yes Cassius and from henceforth
    When you are overearnest with your Brutus
    Hell think your mother chides and leave you so
  POET Within Let me go in to see the generals
    There is some grudge between em tis not meet
    They be alone
  LUCILIUS Within You shall not come to them
  POET Within Nothing but death shall stay me

      Enter Poet followed by Lucilius Titinius and Lucius

  CASSIUS How now whats the matter
  POET For shame you generals What do you mean
    Love and be friends as two such men should be
    For I have seen more years Im sure than ye
  CASSIUS Ha ha How vilely doth this cynic rhyme
  BRUTUS Get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence
  CASSIUS Bear with him Brutus tis his fashion
  BRUTUS Ill know his humor when he knows his time
    What should the wars do with these jigging fools
    Companion hence
  CASSIUS Away away be gone                       Exit Poet
  BRUTUS Lucilius and Titinius bid the commanders
    Prepare to lodge their companies tonight
  CASSIUS And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
    Immediately to us             Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius
  BRUTUS Lucius a bowl of wine                   Exit Lucius
  CASSIUS I did not think you could have been so angry
  BRUTUS O Cassius I am sick of many griefs
  CASSIUS Of your philosophy you make no use
    If you give place to accidental evils
  BRUTUS No man bears sorrow better Portia is dead
  CASSIUS Ha Portia
  BRUTUS She is dead
  CASSIUS How scaped killing when I crossd you so
    O insupportable and touching loss
    Upon what sickness
  BRUTUS Impatient of my absence
    And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
    Have made themselves so strong for with her death
    That tidings came with this she fell distract
    And her attendants absent swallowd fire
  CASSIUS And died so
  BRUTUS Even so
  CASSIUS O ye immortal gods

               Reenter Lucius with wine and taper

  BRUTUS Speak no more of her Give me a bowl of wine
    In this I bury all unkindness Cassius              Drinks
  CASSIUS My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
  Fill Lucius till the wine oerswell the cup
  I cannot drink too much of Brutus love               Drinks
  BRUTUS Come in Titinius                        Exit Lucius

                 Reenter Titinius with Messala

    Welcome good Messala
    Now sit we close about this taper here
    And call in question our necessities
  CASSIUS Portia art thou gone
  BRUTUS No more I pray you
    Messala I have here received letters
    That young Octavius and Mark Antony
    Come down upon us with a mighty power
    Bending their expedition toward Philippi
  MESSALA Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure
  BRUTUS With what addition
  MESSALA That by proscription and bills of outlawry
    Octavius Antony and Lepidus
    Have put to death an hundred senators
  BRUTUS There in our letters do not well agree
    Mine speak of seventy senators that died
    By their proscriptions Cicero being one
  CASSIUS Cicero one
  MESSALA Cicero is dead
    And by that order of proscription
    Had you your letters from your wife my lord
  BRUTUS No Messala
  MESSALA Nor nothing in your letters writ of her
  BRUTUS Nothing Messala
  MESSALA That methinks is strange
  BRUTUS Why ask you Hear you aught of her in yours
  MESSALA No my lord
  BRUTUS Now as you are a Roman tell me true
  MESSALA Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell
    For certain she is dead and by strange manner
  BRUTUS Why farewell Portia We must die Messala
    With meditating that she must die once
    I have the patience to endure it now
  MESSALA Even so great men great losses should endure
  CASSIUS I have as much of this in art as you
    But yet my nature could not bear it so
  BRUTUS Well to our work alive What do you think
    Of marching to Philippi presently
  CASSIUS I do not think it good
  BRUTUS Your reason
  CASSIUS This it is
    Tis better that the enemy seek us
    So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
    Doing himself offense whilst we lying still
    Are full of rest defense and nimbleness
  BRUTUS Good reasons must of force give place to better
    The people twixt Philippi and this ground
    Do stand but in a forced affection
    For they have grudged us contribution
    The enemy marching along by them
    By them shall make a fuller number up
    Come on refreshd newadded and encouraged
    From which advantage shall we cut him off
    If at Philippi we do face him there
    These people at our back
  CASSIUS Hear me good brother
  BRUTUS Under your pardon You must note beside
    That we have tried the utmost of our friends
    Our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe
    The enemy increaseth every day
    We at the height are ready to decline
    There is a tide in the affairs of men
    Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
    Omitted all the voyage of their life
    Is bound in shallows and in miseries
    On such a full sea are we now afloat
    And we must take the current when it serves
    Or lose our ventures
  CASSIUS Then with your will go on
    Well along ourselves and meet them at Philippi
  BRUTUS The deep of night is crept upon our talk
    And nature must obey necessity
    Which we will niggard with a little rest
    There is no more to say
  CASSIUS No more Good night
    Early tomorrow will we rise and hence
  BRUTUS Lucius

                       Reenter Lucius

ACT V SCENE I
The plains of Philippi

Enter Octavius Antony and their Army

  OCTAVIUS Now Antony our hopes are answered
    You said the enemy would not come down
    But keep the hills and upper regions
    It proves not so Their battles are at hand
    They mean to warn us at Philippi here
    Answering before we do demand of them
  ANTONY Tut I am in their bosoms and I know
    Wherefore they do it They could be content
    To visit other places and come down
    With fearful bravery thinking by this face
    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
    But tis not so

                    Enter a Messenger

  MESSENGER Prepare you generals
    The enemy comes on in gallant show
    Their bloody sign of battle is hung out
    And something to be done immediately
  ANTONY Octavius lead your battle softly on
    Upon the left hand of the even field
  OCTAVIUS Upon the right hand I keep thou the left
  ANTONY Why do you cross me in this exigent
  OCTAVIUS I do not cross you but I will do so

      March Drum Enter Brutus Cassius and their Army
           Lucilius Titinius Messala and others

  BRUTUS They stand and would have parley
  CASSIUS Stand fast Titinius we must out and talk
  OCTAVIUS Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle
  ANTONY No Caesar we will answer on their charge
    Make forth the generals would have some words
  OCTAVIUS Stir not until the signal not until the signal
  BRUTUS Words before blows Is it so countrymen
  OCTAVIUS Not that we love words better as you do
  BRUTUS Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius
  ANTONY In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words
    Witness the hole you made in Caesars heart
    Crying Long live Hail Caesar
  CASSIUS Antony
    The posture of your blows are yet unknown
    But for your words they rob the Hybla bees
    And leave them honeyless
  ANTONY Not stingless too
  BRUTUS O yes and soundless too
    For you have stoln their buzzing Antony
    And very wisely threat before you sting
  ANTONY Villains You did not so when your vile daggers
    Hackd one another in the sides of Caesar
    You showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds
    And bowd like bondmen kissing Caesars feet
    Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind
    Strooke Caesar on the neck O you flatterers
  CASSIUS Flatterers Now Brutus thank yourself
    This tongue had not offended so today
    If Cassius might have ruled
  OCTAVIUS Come come the cause If arguing make us sweat
    The proof of it will turn to redder drops
    Look
    I draw a sword against conspirators
    When think you that the sword goes up again
    Never till Caesars three and thirty wounds
    Be well avenged or till another Caesar
    Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
  BRUTUS Caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands
    Unless thou bringst them with thee
  OCTAVIUS So I hope
    I was not born to die on Brutus sword
  BRUTUS O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
    Young man thou couldst not die more honorable
  CASSIUS A peevish school boy worthless of such honor
    Joind with a masker and a reveler
  ANTONY Old Cassius still
  OCTAVIUS Come Antony away
    Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
    If you dare fight today come to the field
    If not when you have stomachs
                        Exeunt Octavius Antony and their Army
  CASSIUS Why now blow and swell billow and swim bark
    The storm is up and all is on the hazard
  BRUTUS Ho Lucilius Hark a word with you
  LUCILIUS Stands forth My lord
                             Brutus and Lucilius converse apart
  CASSIUS Messala
  MESSALA Stands forth What says my general
  CASSIUS Messala
    This is my birthday as this very day
    Was Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala
    Be thou my witness that against my will
    As Pompey was am I compelld to set
    Upon one battle all our liberties
    You know that I held Epicurus strong
    And his opinion Now I change my mind
    And partly credit things that do presage
    Coming from Sardis on our former ensign
    Two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd
    Gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands
    Who to Philippi here consorted us
    This morning are they fled away and gone
    And in their steads do ravens crows and kites
    Fly oer our heads and downward look on us
    As we were sickly prey Their shadows seem
    A canopy most fatal under which
    Our army lies ready to give up the ghost
  MESSALA Believe not so
  CASSIUS I but believe it partly
    For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
    To meet all perils very constantly
  BRUTUS Even so Lucilius
  CASSIUS Now most noble Brutus
    The gods today stand friendly that we may
    Lovers in peace lead on our days to age
    But since the affairs of men rest still incertain
    Lets reason with the worst that may befall
    If we do lose this battle then is this
    The very last time we shall speak together
    What are you then determined to do
  BRUTUS Even by the rule of that philosophy
    By which I did blame Cato for the death
    Which he did give himself I know not how
    But I do find it cowardly and vile
    For fear of what might fall so to prevent
    The time of life arming myself with patience
    To stay the providence of some high powers
    That govern us below
  CASSIUS Then if we lose this battle
    You are contented to be led in triumph
    Thorough the streets of Rome
  BRUTUS No Cassius no Think not thou noble Roman
    That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome
    He bears too great a mind But this same day
    Must end that work the ides of March begun
    And whether we shall meet again I know not
    Therefore our everlasting farewell take
    Forever and forever farewell Cassius
    If we do meet again why we shall smile
    If not why then this parting was well made
  CASSIUS Forever and forever farewell Brutus
    If we do meet again well smile indeed
    If not tis true this parting was well made
  BRUTUS Why then lead on O that a man might know
    The end of this days business ere it come
    But it sufficeth that the day will end
    And then the end is known Come ho Away           Exeunt




SCENE II
The field of battle

Alarum Enter Brutus and Messala

  BRUTUS Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills
    Unto the legions on the other side             Loud alarum
    Let them set on at once for I perceive
    But cold demeanor in Octavias wing
    And sudden push gives them the overthrow
    Ride ride Messala Let them all come down         Exeunt




SCENE III
Another part of the field

Alarums Enter Cassius and Titinius

  CASSIUS O look Titinius look the villains fly
    Myself have to mine own turnd enemy
    This ensign here of mine was turning back
    I slew the coward and did take it from him
  TITINIUS O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early
    Who having some advantage on Octavius
    Took it too eagerly His soldiers fell to spoil
    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed

                       Enter Pindarus

  PINDARUS Fly further off my lord fly further off
    Mark Antony is in your tents my lord
    Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off
  CASSIUS This hill is far enough Look look Titinius
    Are those my tents where I perceive the fire
  TITINIUS They are my lord
  CASSIUS Titinius if thou lovest me
    Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
    Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
    And here again that I may rest assured
    Whether yond troops are friend or enemy
  TITINIUS I will be here again even with a thought     Exit
  CASSIUS Go Pindarus get higher on that hill
    My sight was ever thick regard Titinius
    And tell me what thou notest about the field
                                      Pindarus ascends the hill
    This day I breathed first time is come round
    And where I did begin there shall I end
    My life is run his compass Sirrah what news
  PINDARUS Above O my lord
  CASSIUS What news
  PINDARUS Above Titinius is enclosed round about
    With horsemen that make to him on the spur
    Yet he spurs on Now they are almost on him
    Now Titinius Now some light O he lights too
    Hes taen Shout And hark They shout for joy
  CASSIUS Come down behold no more
    O coward that I am to live so long
    To see my best friend taen before my face
                                              Pindarus descends
    Come hither sirrah
    In Parthia did I take thee prisoner
    And then I swore thee saving of thy life
    That whatsoever I did bid thee do
    Thou shouldst attempt it Come now keep thine oath
    Now be a freeman and with this good sword
    That ran through Caesars bowels search this bosom
    Stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
    And when my face is coverd as tis now
    Guide thou the sword Pindarus stabs him Caesar thou art
      revenged
    Even with the sword that killd thee                  Dies
  PINDARUS So I am free yet would not so have been
    Durst I have done my will O Cassius
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run
    Where never Roman shall take note of him              Exit

                Reenter Titinius with Messala

  MESSALA It is but change Titinius for Octavius
    Is overthrown by noble Brutus power
    As Cassius legions are by Antony
  TITINIUS These tidings would well comfort Cassius
  MESSALA Where did you leave him
  TITINIUS All disconsolate
    With Pindarus his bondman on this hill
  MESSALA Is not that he that lies upon the ground
  TITINIUS He lies not like the living O my heart
  MESSALA Is not that he
  TITINIUS No this was he Messala
    But Cassius is no more O setting sun
    As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night
    So in his red blood Cassius day is set
    The sun of Rome is set Our day is gone
    Clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
    Mistrust of my success hath done this deed
  MESSALA Mistrust of good success hath done this deed
    O hateful error melancholys child
    Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
    The things that are not O error soon conceived
    Thou never comest unto a happy birth
    But killst the mother that engenderd thee
  TITINIUS What Pindarus Where art thou Pindarus
  MESSALA Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet
    The noble Brutus thrusting this report
    Into his ears I may say thrusting it
    For piercing steel and darts envenomed
    Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
    As tidings of this sight
  TITINIUS Hie you Messala
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while        Exit Messala
    Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius
    Did I not meet thy friends And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory
    And bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts
    Alas thou hast misconstrued everything
    But hold thee take this garland on thy brow
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I
    Will do his bidding Brutus come apace
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius
    By your leave gods this is a Romans part
    Come Cassius sword and find Titinius heart
                                                  Kills himself

  BRUTUS Titinius face is upward
  CATO He is slain
  BRUTUS O Julius Caesar thou art mighty yet
    Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
    In our own proper entrails                     Low alarums
  CATO Brave Titinius
    Look wheer he have not crownd dead Cassius
  BRUTUS Are yet two Romans living such as these
    The last of all the Romans fare thee well
    It is impossible that ever Rome
    Should breed thy fellow Friends I owe moe tears
    To this dead man than you shall see me pay
    I shall find time Cassius I shall find time
    Come therefore and to Thasos send his body
    His funerals shall not be in our camp
    Lest it discomfort us Lucilius come
    And come young Cato let us to the field
    Labio and Flavio set our battles on
    Tis three oclock and Romans yet ere night

    Our enemies have beat us to the pit            Low alarums
    It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
    Than tarry till they push us Good Volumnius
    Thou knowst that we two went to school together
    Even for that our love of old I prithee
    Hold thou my swordhilts whilst I run on it
  VOLUMNIUS Thats not an office for a friend my lord

    I shall have glory by this losing day
    More than Octavius and Mark Antony
    By this vile conquest shall attain unto
    So fare you well at once for Brutus tongue
    Hath almost ended his lifes history
    Night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest
    That have but labord to attain this hour
                            Alarum Cry within Fly fly fly

  OCTAVIUS What man is that
  MESSALA My masters man Strato where is thy master
  STRATO Free from the bondage you are in Messala
    The conquerors can but make a fire of him
    For Brutus only overcame himself
    And no man else hath honor by his death
  LUCILIUS So Brutus should be found I thank thee Brutus
    That thou hast proved Lucilius saying true
  OCTAVIUS All that served Brutus I will entertain them
    Fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me
  STRATO Ay if Messala will prefer me to you
  OCTAVIUS Do so good Messala
  MESSALA How died my master Strato
  STRATO I held the sword and he did run on it
  MESSALA Octavius then take him to follow thee
    That did the latest service to my master
  ANTONY This was the noblest Roman of them all
    All the conspirators save only he
    Did that they did in envy of great Caesar
    He only in a general honest thought
    And common good to all made one of them
    His life was gentle and the elements
    So mixd in him that Nature might stand up
    And say to all the world This was a man
  OCTAVIUS According to his virtue let us use him
    With all respect and rites of burial
    Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie
    Most like a soldier ordered honorably
    So call the field to rest and lets away
    To part the glories of this happy day              Exeunt

THE PROLOGUE

 Enter Chorus

CHORUS
Two households both alike in dignity
In fair Verona where we lay our scene
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of starcrossd lovers take their life
Whose misadventurd piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents strife
The fearful passage of their deathmarkd love
And the continuance of their parents rage
Which but their childrens end nought could remove
Is now the two hours traffic of our stage
The which if you with patient ears attend
What here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend

 Exit



ACT I

SCENE I A public place

 Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers

SAMPSON
Gregory on my word well not carry coals

GREGORY

SAMPSON
I mean if we be in choler well draw

GREGORY
Ay while you live draw your neck out o the collar

SAMPSON
I strike quickly being moved

GREGORY
But thou art not quickly moved to strike

SAMPSON
A dog of the house of Montague moves me

GREGORY
To move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand therefore if thou
art moved thou runnst away

SAMPSON
A dog of that house shall move me to stand
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montagues

GREGORY
That shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes to the wall

SAMPSON
True and therefore women being the weaker vessels are ever thrust to
the wall therefore I will push Montagues men from the wall and
thrust his maids to the wall

GREGORY
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men

SAMPSON
Tis all one I will show myself a tyrant when I have fought with the
men I will be civil with the maids I will cut off their heads

GREGORY
The heads of the maids

SAMPSON
Ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads take it in what sense
thou wilt

GREGORY
They must take it in sense that feel it

SAMPSON
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand and tis known I am a
pretty piece of flesh

GREGORY
Tis well thou art not fish if thou hadst thou hadst been poor John
Draw thy tool here comes of the house of Montagues

GREGORY
How Turn thy back and run

SAMPSON
Fear me not

GREGORY
No marry I fear thee

SAMPSON
Let us take the law of our sides let them begin

GREGORY
I will frown as I pass by and let them take it as they list

SAMPSON
Nay as they dare I will bite my thumb at them which is disgrace to
them if they bear it

ABRAM
Do you bite your thumb at us sir

SAMPSON
I do bite my thumb sir

ABRAM
Do you bite your thumb at us sir

SAMPSON
Is the law of our side if I say ay

GREGORY
No

SAMPSON
No sir I do not bite my thumb at you sir but I bite my thumb sir

GREGORY
Do you quarrel sir

ABRAM
Quarrel sir No sir

SAMPSON
But if you do sir am for you I serve as good a man as you

ABRAM

SAMPSON
Well sir

 Beats down their swords

 Enter Tybalt

TYBALT
What art thou drawn among these heartless hinds
Turn thee Benvolio look upon thy death

BENVOLIO
I do but keep the peace put up thy sword
Or manage it to part these men with me

TYBALT
What drawn and talk of peace I hate the word
As I hate hell all Montagues and thee
Have at thee coward

 They fight

 Enter three or four Citizens with clubs

FIRST CITIZEN
Clubs bills and partisans Strike Beat them down
Down with the Capulets Down with the Montagues

 Enter Capulet in his gown and Lady Capulet

CAPULET
What noise is this Give me my long sword ho

LADY CAPULET
A crutch a crutch Why call you for a sword

CAPULET
My sword I say Old Montague is come
And flourishes his blade in spite of me

 Enter Montague and his Lady Montague

MONTAGUE
Thou villain Capulet Hold me not let me go

LADY MONTAGUE
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe

 Enter Prince Escalus with Attendants

PRINCE
Rebellious subjects enemies to peace
Profaners of this neighbourstained steel
Will they not hear What ho You men you beasts
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins
On pain of torture from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemperd weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved prince
Three civil brawls bred of an airy word
By thee old Capulet and Montague
Have thrice disturbd the quiet of our streets
And made Veronas ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
To wield old partisans in hands as old
Cankerd with peace to part your cankerd hate
If ever you disturb our streets again
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
For this time all the rest depart away
You Capulet shall go along with me
And Montague come you this afternoon
To know our farther pleasure in this case
To old Freetown our common judgementplace
Once more on pain of death all men depart

 Exeunt Prince and Attendants Capulet Lady Capulet Tybalt
 Citizens and Servants

MONTAGUE
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
Speak nephew were you by when it began

BENVOLIO
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours close fighting ere I did approach
I drew to part them in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepard
Which as he breathd defiance to my ears
He swung about his head and cut the winds
Who nothing hurt withal hissd him in scorn
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
Came more and more and fought on part and part
Till the Prince came who parted either part

LADY MONTAGUE
O where is Romeo saw you him today
Right glad I am he was not at this fray

BENVOLIO
Madam an hour before the worshippd sun
Peerd forth the golden window of the east
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
Where underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from this city side
So early walking did I see your son
Towards him I made but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood
I measuring his affections by my own
Which then most sought where most might not be found
Being one too many by my weary self
Pursud my humour not pursuing his
And gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me

MONTAGUE
Many a morning hath he there been seen
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
But all so soon as the allcheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Auroras bed
Away from light steals home my heavy son
And private in his chamber pens himself
Shuts up his windows locks fair daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night
Black and portentous must this humour prove
Unless good counsel may the cause remove

BENVOLIO
My noble uncle do you know the cause

MONTAGUE
I neither know it nor can learn of him

BENVOLIO
Have you importund him by any means

MONTAGUE
Both by myself and many other friends
But he his own affections counsellor
Is to himselfI will not say how true
But to himself so secret and so close
So far from sounding and discovery
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
We would as willingly give cure as know

 Enter Romeo

BENVOLIO
See where he comes So please you step aside
Ill know his grievance or be much denied

MONTAGUE
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift Come madam lets away

 Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague

BENVOLIO
Good morrow cousin

ROMEO
Is the day so young

BENVOLIO
But new struck nine

ROMEO
Ay me sad hours seem long
Was that my father that went hence so fast

BENVOLIO
It was What sadness lengthens Romeos hours

ROMEO
Not having that which having makes them short

BENVOLIO
In love

ROMEO
Out

BENVOLIO
Of love

ROMEO
Out of her favour where I am in love

BENVOLIO
Alas that love so gentle in his view
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof

ROMEO
Alas that love whose view is muffled still
Should without eyes see pathways to his will
Where shall we dine O me What fray was here
Yet tell me not for I have heard it all
Heres much to do with hate but more with love
Why then O brawling love O loving hate
O anything of nothing first create
O heavy lightness serious vanity
Misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms
Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health
Stillwaking sleep that is not what it is
This love feel I that feel no love in this
Dost thou not laugh

BENVOLIO
No coz I rather weep

ROMEO
Good heart at what

BENVOLIO
At thy good hearts oppression

ROMEO
Why such is loves transgression
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
With more of thine This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs
Being purgd a fire sparkling in lovers eyes
Being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears
What is it else A madness most discreet
A choking gall and a preserving sweet
Farewell my coz

 Going

BENVOLIO
Soft I will go along
And if you leave me so you do me wrong

ROMEO
Tut I have lost myself I am not here
This is not Romeo hes some other where

BENVOLIO
Tell me in sadness who is that you love

ROMEO
What shall I groan and tell thee

BENVOLIO
Groan Why no but sadly tell me who

ROMEO
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will
A word ill urgd to one that is so ill
In sadness cousin I do love a woman

BENVOLIO
I aimd so near when I supposd you lovd

ROMEO
A right good markman and shes fair I love

BENVOLIO
A right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit

ROMEO
Well in that hit you miss shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow she hath Dians wit
And in strong proof of chastity well armd
From loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmd
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
Nor bide thencounter of assailing eyes
Nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold
O shes rich in beauty only poor
That when she dies with beauty dies her store

BENVOLIO
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste

ROMEO
She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
For beauty starvd with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity
She is too fair too wise wisely too fair
To merit bliss by making me despair
She hath forsworn to love and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now

BENVOLIO
Be ruld by me forget to think of her

ROMEO
O teach me how I should forget to think

BENVOLIO
By giving liberty unto thine eyes
Examine other beauties

ROMEO
Tis the way
To call hers exquisite in question more
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost
Show me a mistress that is passing fair
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Where I may read who passd that passing fair
Farewell thou canst not teach me to forget

BENVOLIO
Ill pay that doctrine or else die in debt

 Exeunt

SCENE II A Street

But Montague is bound as well as I
In penalty alike and tis not hard I think
For men so old as we to keep the peace

PARIS
Of honourable reckoning are you both
And pity tis you livd at odds so long
But now my lord what say you to my suit

CAPULET
But saying oer what I have said before
My child is yet a stranger in the world
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride

PARIS
Younger than she are happy mothers made

CAPULET
And too soon marrd are those so early made
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she
She is the hopeful lady of my earth
But woo her gentle Paris get her heart
My will to her consent is but a part
And she agree within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice
This night I hold an old accustomd feast
Whereto I have invited many a guest
Such as I love and you among the store
One more most welcome makes my number more
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earthtreading stars that make dark heaven light
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well apparelld April on the heel
Of limping winter treads even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house Hear all all see
And like her most whose merit most shall be
Which on more view of many mine being one
May stand in number though in reckoning none
Come go with me Go sirrah trudge about

Whose names are written there gives a paper and to them say
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay

names the writing person hath here writ I must to the learned In good
time

 Enter Benvolio and Romeo

BENVOLIO
Tut man one fire burns out anothers burning
One pain is lessend by anothers anguish
Turn giddy and be holp by backward turning
One desperate grief cures with anothers languish
Take thou some new infection to thy eye
And the rank poison of the old will die

ROMEO
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that

BENVOLIO
For what I pray thee

ROMEO
For your broken shin

BENVOLIO
Why Romeo art thou mad

ROMEO

SERVANT

cup of wine Rest you merry

 Exit

BENVOLIO
At this same ancient feast of Capulets
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovst
With all the admired beauties of Verona
Go thither and with unattainted eye
Compare her face with some that I shall show
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow

ROMEO
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fire
And these who often drownd could never die
Transparent heretics be burnt for liars
One fairer than my love The allseeing sun
Neer saw her match since first the world begun

BENVOLIO
Tut you saw her fair none else being by
Herself poisd with herself in either eye
But in that crystal scales let there be weighd
Your ladys love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast
And she shall scant show well that now shows best

ROMEO
Ill go along no such sight to be shown
But to rejoice in splendour of my own

LADY CAPULET
A fortnight and odd days

NURSE
Even or odd of all days in the year
Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen
Susan and sheGod rest all Christian souls
Were of an age Well Susan is with God
She was too good for me But as I said
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen
That shall she marry I remember it well
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years
And she was weandI never shall forget it
Of all the days of the year upon that day
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall
My lord and you were then at Mantua
Nay I do bear a brain But as I said
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
Shake quoth the dovehouse twas no need I trow
To bid me trudge
And since that time it is eleven years
For then she could stand alone nay by throod
She could have run and waddled all about
For even the day before she broke her brow
And then my husbandGod be with his soul
A was a merry mantook up the child
Yea quoth he dost thou fall upon thy face
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit
Wilt thou not Jule and by my holidame
The pretty wretch left crying and said Ay
To see now how a jest shall come about
I warrant and I should live a thousand years
I never should forget it Wilt thou not Jule quoth he
And pretty fool it stinted and said Ay

LADY CAPULET
Enough of this I pray thee hold thy peace

NURSE
Yes madam yet I cannot choose but laugh
To think it should leave crying and say Ay
And yet I warrant it had upon it brow
A bump as big as a young cockerels stone
A perilous knock and it cried bitterly
Yea quoth my husband fallst upon thy face
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age
Wilt thou not Jule it stinted and said Ay

JULIET
And stint thou too I pray thee Nurse say I

NURSE
Peace I have done God mark thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that eer I nursd
And I might live to see thee married once I have my wish

LADY CAPULET
Marry that marry is the very theme
I came to talk of Tell me daughter Juliet
How stands your disposition to be married

JULIET
It is an honour that I dream not of

NURSE
An honour Were not I thine only nurse
I would say thou hadst suckd wisdom from thy teat

LADY CAPULET
Well think of marriage now younger than you
Here in Verona ladies of esteem
Are made already mothers By my count
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid Thus then in brief
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love

NURSE
A man young lady Lady such a man
As all the worldwhy hes a man of wax

LADY CAPULET
Veronas summer hath not such a flower

NURSE
Nay hes a flower in faith a very flower

LADY CAPULET
What say you can you love the gentleman
This night you shall behold him at our feast
Read oer the volume of young Paris face
And find delight writ there with beautys pen
Examine every married lineament
And see how one another lends content
And what obscurd in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes
This precious book of love this unbound lover
To beautify him only lacks a cover
The fish lives in the sea and tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide
That book in manys eyes doth share the glory
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story
So shall you share all that he doth possess
By having him making yourself no less

NURSE
No less nay bigger Women grow by men

LADY CAPULET
Speak briefly can you like of Paris love

JULIET

Than your consent gives strength to make it fly

SCENE IV A Street

 Enter Romeo Mercutio Benvolio with five or six Maskers
 Torchbearers and others

ROMEO
What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
Or shall we on without apology

BENVOLIO
The date is out of such prolixity
Well have no Cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf
Bearing a Tartars painted bow of lath
Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
Nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
After the prompter for our entrance
But let them measure us by what they will
Well measure them a measure and be gone

ROMEO
Give me a torch I am not for this ambling
Being but heavy I will bear the light

MERCUTIO
Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance

ROMEO
Not I believe me you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move

MERCUTIO
You are a lover borrow Cupids wings
And soar with them above a common bound

ROMEO
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers and so bound
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
Under loves heavy burden do I sink

MERCUTIO
And to sink in it should you burden love
Too great oppression for a tender thing

ROMEO
Is love a tender thing It is too rough
Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn

MERCUTIO
If love be rough with you be rough with love
Prick love for pricking and you beat love down
Give me a case to put my visage in Putting on a mask
A visor for a visor What care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities
Here are the beetlebrows shall blush for me

BENVOLIO
Come knock and enter and no sooner in
But every man betake him to his legs

ROMEO
A torch for me let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
For I am proverbd with a grandsire phrase
Ill be a candleholder and look on
The game was neer so fair and I am done

MERCUTIO
Tut duns the mouse the constables own word
If thou art dun well draw thee from the mire
Or save your reverence love wherein thou stickest
Up to the ears Come we burn daylight ho

ROMEO
Nay thats not so

MERCUTIO
I mean sir in delay
We waste our lights in vain light lights by day
Take our good meaning for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits

ROMEO
And we mean well in going to this mask
But tis no wit to go

MERCUTIO
Why may one ask

ROMEO
I dreamt a dream tonight

MERCUTIO
And so did I

ROMEO
Well what was yours

MERCUTIO
That dreamers often lie

ROMEO
In bed asleep while they do dream things true

MERCUTIO
O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
She is the fairies midwife and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agatestone
On the forefinger of an alderman
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Over mens noses as they lie asleep
Her waggonspokes made of long spinners legs
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers
Her traces of the smallest spiders web
The collars of the moonshines watery beams
Her whip of crickets bone the lash of film
Her waggoner a small greycoated gnat
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers brains and then they dream of love
Oer courtiers knees that dream on curtsies straight
Oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
Oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
Sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit
And sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail
Tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep
Then dreams he of another benefice
Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
Of breaches ambuscados Spanish blades
Of healths five fathom deep and then anon
Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
This is the hag when maids lie on their backs
That presses them and learns them first to bear
Making them women of good carriage
This is she

ROMEO
Peace peace Mercutio peace
Thou talkst of nothing

MERCUTIO
True I talk of dreams
Which are the children of an idle brain
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north
And being angerd puffs away from thence
Turning his side to the dewdropping south

BENVOLIO
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
Supper is done and we shall come too late

ROMEO
I fear too early for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this nights revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closd in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death
But he that hath the steerage of my course
Direct my suit On lusty gentlemen

BENVOLIO
Strike drum

 Exeunt

SCENE V A Hall in Capulets House

She Ill swear hath corns Am I come near ye now

A whispering tale in a fair ladys ear
Such as would please tis gone tis gone tis gone
You are welcome gentlemen Come musicians play

More light you knaves and turn the tables up
And quench the fire the room is grown too hot

CAPULETS COUSIN

CAPULET

His son was but a ward two years ago

ROMEO
What lady is that which doth enrich the hand
Of yonder knight

SERVANT
I know not sir

ROMEO
O she doth teach the torches to burn bright
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
As a rich jewel in an Ethiops ear
Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
As yonder lady oer her fellows shows
The measure done Ill watch her place of stand
And touching hers make blessed my rude hand
Did my heart love till now Forswear it sight
For I neer saw true beauty till this night

TYBALT
This by his voice should be a Montague
Fetch me my rapier boy What dares the slave
Come hither coverd with an antic face
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity
Now by the stock and honour of my kin
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin

CAPULET
Why how now kinsman
Wherefore storm you so

TYBALT
Uncle this is a Montague our foe
A villain that is hither come in spite
To scorn at our solemnity this night

CAPULET
Young Romeo is it

TYBALT
Tis he that villain Romeo

CAPULET
Content thee gentle coz let him alone
A bears him like a portly gentleman
And to say truth Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and wellgovernd youth
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement
Therefore be patient take no note of him
It is my will the which if thou respect
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns
An illbeseeming semblance for a feast

TYBALT
It fits when such a villain is a guest
Ill not endure him

CAPULET
He shall be endurd
What goodman boy I say he shall go to
Am I the master here or you Go to
Youll not endure him God shall mend my soul
Youll make a mutiny among my guests
You will set cockahoop youll be the man

TYBALT
Why uncle tis a shame

CAPULET

This trick may chance to scathe you I know what
You must contrary me Marry tis time
Well said my heartsYou are a princox go
Be quiet orMore light more lightFor shame
Ill make you quiet What cheerly my hearts

TYBALT
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting
I will withdraw but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall

 Exit

ROMEO
To Juliet If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine the gentle sin is this
My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss

JULIET
Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
Which mannerly devotion shows in this
For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch
And palm to palm is holy palmers kiss

ROMEO
Have not saints lips and holy palmers too

JULIET
Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer

ROMEO
O then dear saint let lips do what hands do
They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair

JULIET
Saints do not move though grant for prayers sake

ROMEO
Then move not while my prayers effect I take
Thus from my lips by thine my sin is purgd
Kissing her

JULIET
Then have my lips the sin that they have took

ROMEO
Sin from my lips O trespass sweetly urgd
Give me my sin again

JULIET
You kiss by the book

NURSE

ROMEO
Is she a Capulet
O dear account My life is my foes debt

BENVOLIO
Away be gone the sport is at the best

ROMEO
Ay so I fear the more is my unrest

CAPULET

NURSE

Too early seen unknown and known too late
Prodigious birth of love it is to me
That I must love a loathed enemy

ACT II

 Enter Chorus

CHORUS
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
And young affection gapes to be his heir
That fair for which love groand for and would die
With tender Juliet matchd is now not fair
Now Romeo is belovd and loves again
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks
But to his foe supposd he must complain
And she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks
Being held a foe he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
And she as much in love her means much less
To meet her new beloved anywhere
But passion lends them power time means to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet

 Exit

SCENE I An open place adjoining Capulets Garden

 Enter Romeo

ROMEO
Can I go forward when my heart is here
Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out

 He climbs the wall and leaps down within it

 Enter Benvolio and Mercutio

BENVOLIO
Romeo My cousin Romeo Romeo

MERCUTIO
He is wise
And on my life hath stoln him home to bed

BENVOLIO
He ran this way and leapd this orchard wall
Call good Mercutio

MERCUTIO
Nay Ill conjure too
Romeo Humours Madman Passion Lover
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied
Cry but Ah me Pronounce but Love and dove
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word
One nickname for her purblind son and heir
Young Abraham Cupid he that shot so trim
When King Cophetua lovd the beggarmaid
He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
The ape is dead and I must conjure him
I conjure thee by Rosalines bright eyes
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip
By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie
That in thy likeness thou appear to us

BENVOLIO
An if he hear thee thou wilt anger him

MERCUTIO
This cannot anger him Twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress circle
Of some strange nature letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjurd it down
That were some spite My invocation
Is fair and honest and in his mistress name
I conjure only but to raise up him

BENVOLIO
Come he hath hid himself among these trees
To be consorted with the humorous night
Blind is his love and best befits the dark

MERCUTIO
If love be blind love cannot hit the mark
Now will he sit under a medlar tree
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone
O Romeo that she were O that she were
An openarse and thou a poperin pear
Romeo good night Ill to my trucklebed
This fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep
Come shall we go

BENVOLIO
Go then for tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found

 Exeunt

SCENE II Capulets Garden

 Enter Romeo

ROMEO
He jests at scars that never felt a wound

 Juliet appears above at a window

But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she
Be not her maid since she is envious
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it cast it off
It is my lady O it is my love
O that she knew she were
She speaks yet she says nothing What of that
Her eye discourses I will answer it
I am too bold tis not to me she speaks
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
Having some business do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return
What if her eyes were there they in her head
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
O that I were a glove upon that hand
That I might touch that cheek

JULIET
Ay me

ROMEO
She speaks
O speak again bright angel for thou art
As glorious to this night being oer my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazypuffing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air

JULIET
O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
Deny thy father and refuse thy name
Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet

ROMEO
Aside Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this

JULIET
Tis but thy name that is my enemy
Thou art thyself though not a Montague
Whats Montague It is nor hand nor foot
Nor arm nor face nor any other part
Belonging to a man O be some other name
Whats in a name That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet
So Romeo would were he not Romeo calld
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title Romeo doff thy name
And for thy name which is no part of thee
Take all myself

ROMEO
I take thee at thy word
Call me but love and Ill be new baptisd
Henceforth I never will be Romeo

JULIET
What man art thou that thus bescreend in night
So stumblest on my counsel

ROMEO
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am
My name dear saint is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee
Had I it written I would tear the word

JULIET
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongues utterance yet I know the sound
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague

ROMEO
Neither fair maid if either thee dislike

JULIET
How camst thou hither tell me and wherefore
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb
And the place death considering who thou art
If any of my kinsmen find thee here

ROMEO
With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls
For stony limits cannot hold love out
And what love can do that dares love attempt
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me

JULIET
If they do see thee they will murder thee

ROMEO
Alack there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords Look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity

JULIET
I would not for the world they saw thee here

ROMEO
I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes
And but thou love me let them find me here
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogued wanting of thy love

JULIET
By whose direction foundst thou out this place

ROMEO
By love that first did prompt me to enquire
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes
I am no pilot yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washd with the farthest sea
I should adventure for such merchandise

JULIET
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny
What I have spoke but farewell compliment
Dost thou love me I know thou wilt say Ay
And I will take thy word Yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false At lovers perjuries
They say Jove laughs O gentle Romeo
If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won
Ill frown and be perverse and say thee nay
So thou wilt woo But else not for the world
In truth fair Montague I am too fond
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light
But trust me gentleman Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange
I should have been more strange I must confess
But that thou overheardst ere I was ware
My truelove passion therefore pardon me
And not impute this yielding to light love
Which the dark night hath so discovered

ROMEO
Lady by yonder blessed moon I vow
That tips with silver all these fruittree tops

JULIET
O swear not by the moon thinconstant moon
That monthly changes in her circled orb
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable

ROMEO
What shall I swear by

JULIET
Do not swear at all
Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
Which is the god of my idolatry
And Ill believe thee

ROMEO
If my hearts dear love

JULIET
Well do not swear Although I joy in thee
I have no joy of this contract tonight
It is too rash too unadvisd too sudden
Too like the lightning which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens Sweet good night
This bud of love by summers ripening breath
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
Good night good night As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast

ROMEO
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied

JULIET
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight

ROMEO
Thexchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine

JULIET
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it
And yet I would it were to give again

ROMEO
Wouldst thou withdraw it For what purpose love

JULIET
But to be frank and give it thee again
And yet I wish but for the thing I have
My bounty is as boundless as the sea
My love as deep the more I give to thee
The more I have for both are infinite
I hear some noise within Dear love adieu
Nurse calls within
Anon good NurseSweet Montague be true
Stay but a little I will come again

 Exit

ROMEO
O blessed blessed night I am afeard
Being in night all this is but a dream
Too flattering sweet to be substantial

 Enter Juliet above

JULIET
Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed
If that thy bent of love be honourable
Thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow
By one that Ill procure to come to thee
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world

NURSE
Within Madam

JULIET
I come anon But if thou meanest not well
I do beseech thee

NURSE
Within Madam

JULIET
By and by I come
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief
Tomorrow will I send

ROMEO
So thrive my soul

JULIET
A thousand times good night

 Exit

ROMEO
A thousand times the worse to want thy light
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books
But love from love towards school with heavy looks

 Retiring slowly

 Reenter Juliet above

JULIET
Hist Romeo hist O for a falconers voice
To lure this tasselgentle back again
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
With repetition of my Romeos name

ROMEO
It is my soul that calls upon my name
How silversweet sound lovers tongues by night
Like softest music to attending ears

JULIET
Romeo

ROMEO
My nyas

JULIET
What oclock tomorrow
Shall I send to thee

ROMEO
By the hour of nine

JULIET
I will not fail Tis twenty years till then
I have forgot why I did call thee back

ROMEO
Let me stand here till thou remember it

JULIET
I shall forget to have thee still stand there
Remembering how I love thy company

ROMEO
And Ill still stay to have thee still forget
Forgetting any other home but this

JULIET
Tis almost morning I would have thee gone
And yet no farther than a wantons bird
That lets it hop a little from her hand
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
And with a silk thread plucks it back again
So lovingjealous of his liberty

ROMEO
I would I were thy bird

JULIET
Sweet so would I
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing
Good night good night Parting is such sweet sorrow
That I shall say good night till it be morrow

 Exit

ROMEO
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
The greyeyd morn smiles on the frowning night
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
And darkness fleckled like a drunkard reels
From forth days pathway made by Titans wheels
Hence will I to my ghostly Sires cell
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell

 Exit

SCENE III Friar Lawrences Cell

 Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Now ere the sun advance his burning eye
The day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry
I must upfill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
The earth thats natures mother is her tomb
What is her burying grave that is her womb
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find
Many for many virtues excellent
None but for some and yet all different
O mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants herbs stones and their true qualities
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give
Nor aught so good but straind from that fair use
Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
And vice sometimes by action dignified

 Enter Romeo

Within the infant rind of this weak flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power
For this being smelt with that part cheers each part
Being tasted slays all senses with the heart
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbsgrace and rude will
And where the worser is predominant
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant

ROMEO
Good morrow father

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Benedicite
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me
Young son it argues a distemperd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
Care keeps his watch in every old mans eye
And where care lodges sleep will never lie
But where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain
Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uprousd with some distemperature
Or if not so then here I hit it right
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight

ROMEO
That last is true the sweeter rest was mine

FRIAR LAWRENCE
God pardon sin Wast thou with Rosaline

ROMEO
With Rosaline my ghostly father No
I have forgot that name and that names woe

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Thats my good son But where hast thou been then

ROMEO
Ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again
I have been feasting with mine enemy
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
Thats by me wounded Both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies
I bear no hatred blessed man for lo
My intercession likewise steads my foe

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Be plain good son and homely in thy drift
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift

ROMEO
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet
As mine on hers so hers is set on mine
And all combind save what thou must combine
By holy marriage When and where and how
We met we wood and made exchange of vow
Ill tell thee as we pass but this I pray
That thou consent to marry us today

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Holy Saint Francis What a change is here
Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear
So soon forsaken Young mens love then lies
Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
Jesu Maria what a deal of brine
Hath washd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline
How much salt water thrown away in waste
To season love that of it doth not taste
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears
Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not washd off yet
If ere thou wast thyself and these woes thine
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline
And art thou changd Pronounce this sentence then
Women may fall when theres no strength in men

ROMEO
Thou chiddst me oft for loving Rosaline

FRIAR LAWRENCE
For doting not for loving pupil mine

ROMEO
And badst me bury love

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Not in a grave
To lay one in another out to have

ROMEO
I pray thee chide me not her I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow
The other did not so

FRIAR LAWRENCE
O she knew well
Thy love did read by rote that could not spell
But come young waverer come go with me
In one respect Ill thy assistant be
For this alliance may so happy prove
To turn your households rancour to pure love

ROMEO
O let us hence I stand on sudden haste

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Wisely and slow they stumble that run fast

 Exeunt

SCENE IV A Street

 Enter Benvolio and Mercutio

MERCUTIO
Where the devil should this Romeo be Came he not home tonight

BENVOLIO
Not to his fathers I spoke with his man

MERCUTIO
Why that same pale hardhearted wench that Rosaline torments him so
that he will sure run mad

BENVOLIO
Tybalt the kinsman to old Capulet hath sent a letter to his fathers
house

MERCUTIO
A challenge on my life

BENVOLIO
Romeo will answer it

MERCUTIO
Any man that can write may answer a letter

BENVOLIO
Nay he will answer the letters master how he dares being dared

MERCUTIO
Alas poor Romeo he is already dead stabbed with a white wenchs black
eye run through the ear with a love song the very pin of his heart
cleft with the blind bowboys buttshaft And is he a man to encounter
Tybalt

BENVOLIO
Why what is Tybalt

MERCUTIO
More than Prince of cats O hes the courageous captain of
compliments He fights as you sing pricksong keeps time distance
and proportion He rests his minim rest one two and the third in
your bosom the very butcher of a silk button a duellist a duellist
a gentleman of the very first house of the first and second cause Ah
the immortal passado the punto reverso the hay

BENVOLIO
The what

MERCUTIO
The pox of such antic lisping affecting phantasies these new tuners
of accent By Jesu a very good blade a very tall man a very good
whore Why is not this a lamentable thing grandsire that we should
be thus afflicted with these strange flies these fashionmongers
these pardonmes who stand so much on the new form that they cannot
sit at ease on the old bench O their bones their bones

 Enter Romeo

BENVOLIO
Here comes Romeo here comes Romeo

MERCUTIO
Without his roe like a dried herring O flesh flesh how art thou
fishified Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in Laura to
his lady was but a kitchen wenchmarry she had a better love to
berhyme her Dido a dowdy Cleopatra a gypsy Helen and Hero hildings
and harlots Thisbe a grey eye or so but not to the purpose Signior
Romeo bonjour Theres a French salutation to your French slop You
gave us the counterfeit fairly last night

ROMEO
Good morrow to you both What counterfeit did I give you

MERCUTIO
The slip sir the slip can you not conceive

ROMEO
Pardon good Mercutio my business was great and in such a case as
mine a man may strain courtesy

MERCUTIO
Thats as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bow
in the hams

ROMEO
Meaning to curtsy

MERCUTIO
Thou hast most kindly hit it

ROMEO
A most courteous exposition

MERCUTIO
Nay I am the very pink of courtesy

ROMEO
Pink for flower

MERCUTIO
Right

ROMEO
Why then is my pump well flowered

MERCUTIO
Sure wit follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump
that when the single sole of it is worn the jest may remain after the
wearing solely singular

ROMEO
O singlesoled jest solely singular for the singleness

MERCUTIO
Come between us good Benvolio my wits faint

ROMEO
Swits and spurs swits and spurs or Ill cry a match

MERCUTIO
Nay if thy wits run the wildgoose chase I am done For thou hast
more of the wildgoose in one of thy wits than I am sure I have in my
whole five Was I with you there for the goose

ROMEO
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the
goose

MERCUTIO
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest

ROMEO
Nay good goose bite not

MERCUTIO
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most sharp sauce

ROMEO
And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose

MERCUTIO
O heres a wit of cheveril that stretches from an inch narrow to an
ell broad

ROMEO
I stretch it out for that word broad which added to the goose proves
thee far and wide a broad goose

MERCUTIO
Why is not this better now than groaning for love Now art thou
sociable now art thou Romeo not art thou what thou art by art as
well as by nature For this drivelling love is like a great natural
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole

BENVOLIO
Stop there stop there

MERCUTIO
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair

BENVOLIO
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large

MERCUTIO
O thou art deceived I would have made it short for I was come to the
whole depth of my tale and meant indeed to occupy the argument no
longer

 Enter Nurse and Peter

prick of noon

NURSE

ROMEO
One gentlewoman that God hath made for himself to mar

NURSE
By my troth it is well said for himself to mar quoth a Gentlemen
can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo

ROMEO
I can tell you but young Romeo will be older when you have found him
than he was when you sought him I am the youngest of that name for
fault of a worse

NURSE
You say well

MERCUTIO
Yea is the worst well Very well took ifaith wisely wisely

NURSE

BENVOLIO
She will endite him to some supper

MERCUTIO
A bawd a bawd a bawd So ho

ROMEO
What hast thou found

MERCUTIO
No hare sir unless a hare sir in a lenten pie that is something
stale and hoar ere it be spent
Sings
    An old hare hoar
    And an old hare hoar
  Is very good meat in Lent
    But a hare that is hoar
    Is too much for a score
  When it hoars ere it be spent
Romeo will you come to your fathers Well to dinner thither

ROMEO
I will follow you

MERCUTIO
Farewell ancient lady farewell lady lady lady

 Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio

NURSE

NURSE
And a speak anything against me Ill take him down and a were lustier

PETER
I saw no man use you at his pleasure if I had my weapon should
quickly have been out I warrant you I dare draw as soon as another
man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side

NURSE
Now afore God I am so vexed that every part about me quivers Scurvy
knave Pray you sir a word and as I told you my young lady bid me
enquire you out what she bade me say I will keep to myself But first
let me tell ye if ye should lead her in a fools paradise as they
say it were a very gross kind of behaviour as they say for the
gentlewoman is young And therefore if you should deal double with
her truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman and
very weak dealing

ROMEO Nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress I protest unto
thee

NURSE
Good heart and ifaith I will tell her as much Lord Lord she will
be a joyful woman

ROMEO

NURSE

gentlemanlike offer

And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair
Which to the high topgallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night
Farewell be trusty and Ill quit thy pains
Farewell commend me to thy mistress

SCENE V Capulets Garden

 Enter Juliet

JULIET
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse
In half an hour she promised to return
Perchance she cannot meet him Thats not so
O she is lame Loves heralds should be thoughts
Which ten times faster glides than the suns beams
Driving back shadows over lowering hills
Therefore do nimblepiniond doves draw love
And therefore hath the windswift Cupid wings
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this days journey and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours yet she is not come
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
Shed be as swift in motion as a ball
My words would bandy her to my sweet love
And his to me
But old folks many feign as they were dead
Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead

 Enter Nurse and Peter

O God she comes O honey Nurse what news
Hast thou met with him Send thy man away

NURSE
Peter stay at the gate

 Exit Peter

JULIET
Now good sweet NurseO Lord why lookst thou sad
Though news be sad yet tell them merrily
If good thou shamst the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face

NURSE
I am aweary give me leave awhile
Fie how my bones ache What a jaunt have I had

JULIET
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news
Nay come I pray thee speak good good Nurse speak

NURSE
Jesu what haste Can you not stay a while Do you not see that I am
out of breath

JULIET
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
Is thy news good or bad Answer to that
Say either and Ill stay the circumstance
Let me be satisfied ist good or bad

NURSE
Well you have made a simple choice you know not how to choose a man
Romeo No not he Though his face be better than any mans yet his
leg excels all mens and for a hand and a foot and a body though
they be not to be talked on yet they are past compare He is not the
flower of courtesy but Ill warrant him as gentle as a lamb Go thy
ways wench serve God What have you dined at home

JULIET
No no But all this did I know before
What says he of our marriage What of that

NURSE
Lord how my head aches What a head have I
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces
My back o tother sideO my back my back
Beshrew your heart for sending me about
To catch my death with jauncing up and down

JULIET

And a courteous and a kind and a handsome

JULIET

There stays a husband to make you a wife
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks
Theyll be in scarlet straight at any news
Hie you to church I must another way
To fetch a ladder by the which your love
Must climb a birds nest soon when it is dark
I am the drudge and toil in your delight
But you shall bear the burden soon at night
Go Ill to dinner hie you to the cell

JULIET
Hie to high fortune Honest Nurse farewell

 Exeunt

SCENE VI Friar Lawrences Cell

 Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo

FRIAR LAWRENCE
So smile the heavens upon this holy act
That afterhours with sorrow chide us not

ROMEO
Amen amen but come what sorrow can
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight
Do thou but close our hands with holy words
Then lovedevouring death do what he dare
It is enough I may but call her mine

FRIAR LAWRENCE
These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die like fire and powder
Which as they kiss consume The sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite
Therefore love moderately long love doth so
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow

 Enter Juliet

Here comes the lady O so light a foot
Will neer wear out the everlasting flint
A lover may bestride the gossamers
That idles in the wanton summer air
And yet not fall so light is vanity

JULIET
Good even to my ghostly confessor

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both

JULIET
As much to him else is his thanks too much

ROMEO
Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy
Be heapd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air and let rich musics tongue
Unfold the imagind happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter

JULIET
Conceit more rich in matter than in words
Brags of his substance not of ornament
They are but beggars that can count their worth
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Come come with me and we will make short work
For by your leaves you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one

 Exeunt



ACT III

SCENE I A public Place

 Enter Mercutio Benvolio Page and Servants

BENVOLIO
I pray thee good Mercutio lets retire
The day is hot the Capulets abroad
And if we meet we shall not scape a brawl
For now these hot days is the mad blood stirring

MERCUTIO
Thou art like one of these fellows that when he enters the confines of
a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says God send me no
need of thee and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the
drawer when indeed there is no need

BENVOLIO
Am I like such a fellow

MERCUTIO
Come come thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy and as
soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be moved

BENVOLIO
And what to

MERCUTIO
Nay an there were two such we should have none shortly for one would
kill the other Thou Why thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a
hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast Thou wilt quarrel
with a man for cracking nuts having no other reason but because thou
hast hazel eyes What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy
head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling Thou hast
quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun Didst thou not fall
out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband And yet thou wilt
tutor me from quarrelling

BENVOLIO
And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy the fee
simple of my life for an hour and a quarter

MERCUTIO
The fee simple O simple

 Enter Tybalt and others

BENVOLIO
By my head here comes the Capulets

MERCUTIO
By my heel I care not

TYBALT
Follow me close for I will speak to them
Gentlemen goodden a word with one of you

MERCUTIO
And but one word with one of us Couple it with something make it a
word and a blow

TYBALT
You shall find me apt enough to that sir and you will give me
occasion

MERCUTIO
Could you not take some occasion without giving

TYBALT
Mercutio thou consortest with Romeo

MERCUTIO
Consort What dost thou make us minstrels And thou make minstrels of
us look to hear nothing but discords Heres my fiddlestick heres
that shall make you dance Zounds consort

BENVOLIO
We talk here in the public haunt of men
Either withdraw unto some private place
And reason coldly of your grievances
Or else depart here all eyes gaze on us

MERCUTIO
Mens eyes were made to look and let them gaze
I will not budge for no mans pleasure I

 Enter Romeo

TYBALT
Well peace be with you sir here comes my man

MERCUTIO
But Ill be hanged sir if he wear your livery
Marry go before to field hell be your follower
Your worship in that sense may call him man

TYBALT
Romeo the love I bear thee can afford
No better term than this Thou art a villain

ROMEO
Tybalt the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting Villain am I none
Therefore farewell I see thou knowst me not

TYBALT
Boy this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me therefore turn and draw

ROMEO
I do protest I never injurd thee
But love thee better than thou canst devise
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love
And so good Capulet which name I tender
As dearly as mine own be satisfied

MERCUTIO
O calm dishonourable vile submission
Draws Alla stoccata carries it away
Tybalt you ratcatcher will you walk

TYBALT
What wouldst thou have with me

MERCUTIO
Good King of Cats nothing but one of your nine lives that I mean to
make bold withal and as you shall use me hereafter drybeat the rest
of the eight Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears
Make haste lest mine be about your ears ere it be out

TYBALT

MERCUTIO

grave man I am peppered I warrant for this world A plague o both

death A braggart a rogue a villain that fights by the book of
arithmeticWhy the devil came you between us I was hurt under your

MERCUTIO
Help me into some house Benvolio
Or I shall faint A plague o both your houses
They have made worms meat of me
I have it and soundly too Your houses

 Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio

ROMEO
This gentleman the Princes near ally
My very friend hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf my reputation staind
With Tybalts slanderTybalt that an hour
Hath been my cousin O sweet Juliet
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper softend valours steel

 Reenter Benvolio

BENVOLIO
O Romeo Romeo brave Mercutios dead
That gallant spirit hath aspird the clouds
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth

ROMEO
This days black fate on mo days doth depend
This but begins the woe others must end

 Reenter Tybalt

BENVOLIO
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again

ROMEO
Again in triumph and Mercutio slain
Away to heaven respective lenity
And fireeyd fury be my conduct now
Now Tybalt take the villain back again
That late thou gavst me for Mercutios soul
Is but a little way above our heads
Staying for thine to keep him company
Either thou or I or both must go with him

TYBALT
Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here
Shalt with him hence

ROMEO
This shall determine that

 They fight Tybalt falls

BENVOLIO
Romeo away be gone
The citizens are up and Tybalt slain
Stand not amazd The Prince will doom thee death
If thou art taken Hence be gone away

ROMEO
O I am fortunes fool

BENVOLIO
Why dost thou stay

 Exit Romeo

 Enter Citizens

FIRST CITIZEN
Which way ran he that killd Mercutio
Tybalt that murderer which way ran he

BENVOLIO
There lies that Tybalt

FIRST CITIZEN
Up sir go with me
I charge thee in the Princes name obey

 Enter Prince attended Montague Capulet their Wives and others

PRINCE
Where are the vile beginners of this fray

BENVOLIO
O noble Prince I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
There lies the man slain by young Romeo
That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio

LADY CAPULET
Tybalt my cousin O my brothers child
O Prince O husband O the blood is spilld
Of my dear kinsman Prince as thou art true
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague
O cousin cousin

PRINCE
Benvolio who began this bloody fray

BENVOLIO
Tybalt here slain whom Romeos hand did slay
Romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink
How nice the quarrel was and urgd withal
Your high displeasure All this uttered
With gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutios breast
Who all as hot turns deadly point to point
And with a martial scorn with one hand beats
Cold death aside and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt whose dexterity
Retorts it Romeo he cries aloud
Hold friends Friends part and swifter than his tongue
His agile arm beats down their fatal points
And twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled
But by and by comes back to Romeo
Who had but newly entertaind revenge
And tot they go like lightning for ere I
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly
This is the truth or let Benvolio die

LADY CAPULET
He is a kinsman to the Montague
Affection makes him false he speaks not true
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
And all those twenty could but kill one life
I beg for justice which thou Prince must give
Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live

PRINCE
Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe

MONTAGUE
Not Romeo Prince he was Mercutios friend
His fault concludes but what the law should end
The life of Tybalt

PRINCE
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence
I have an interest in your hates proceeding
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding
But Ill amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
Therefore use none Let Romeo hence in haste
Else when he is found that hour is his last
Bear hence this body and attend our will
Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill

 Exeunt

SCENE II A Room in Capulets House

 Enter Juliet

JULIET
Gallop apace you fieryfooted steeds
Towards Phoebus lodging Such a waggoner
As Phaeton would whip you to the west
And bring in cloudy night immediately
Spread thy close curtain loveperforming night
That runaways eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms untalkd of and unseen
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties or if love be blind
It best agrees with night Come civil night
Thou sobersuited matron all in black
And learn me how to lose a winning match
Playd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
Hood my unmannd blood bating in my cheeks
With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold
Think true love acted simple modesty
Come night come Romeo come thou day in night
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow upon a ravens back
Come gentle night come loving blackbrowd night
Give me my Romeo and when I shall die
Take him and cut him out in little stars
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun
O I have bought the mansion of a love
But not possessd it and though I am sold
Not yet enjoyd So tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them O here comes my Nurse
And she brings news and every tongue that speaks
But Romeos name speaks heavenly eloquence

 Enter Nurse with cords

Now Nurse what news What hast thou there
The cords that Romeo bid thee fetch

NURSE
Ay ay the cords

 Throws them down

JULIET
Ay me what news Why dost thou wring thy hands

NURSE
Ah welladay hes dead hes dead hes dead
We are undone lady we are undone
Alack the day hes gone hes killd hes dead

JULIET
Can heaven be so envious

NURSE
Romeo can
Though heaven cannot O Romeo Romeo
Who ever would have thought it Romeo

JULIET
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus
This torture should be roard in dismal hell
Hath Romeo slain himself Say thou but Ay
And that bare vowel I shall poison more
Than the deathdarting eye of cockatrice
I am not I if there be such an I
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay
If he be slain say Ay or if not No
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe

NURSE
I saw the wound I saw it with mine eyes
God save the markhere on his manly breast
A piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
Pale pale as ashes all bedaubd in blood
All in goreblood I swounded at the sight

JULIET
O break my heart Poor bankrout break at once
To prison eyes neer look on liberty
Vile earth to earth resign end motion here
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier

NURSE
O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had
O courteous Tybalt honest gentleman
That ever I should live to see thee dead

JULIET
What storm is this that blows so contrary
Is Romeo slaughterd and is Tybalt dead
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
For who is living if those two are gone

NURSE
Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished
Romeo that killd him he is banished

JULIET
O God Did Romeos hand shed Tybalts blood

NURSE
It did it did alas the day it did

JULIET
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
Beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
Dovefeatherd raven wolvishravening lamb
Despised substance of divinest show
Just opposite to what thou justly seemst
A damned saint an honourable villain
O nature what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace

NURSE
Theres no trust
No faith no honesty in men All perjurd
All forsworn all naught all dissemblers
Ah wheres my man Give me some aqua vitae
These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
Shame come to Romeo

JULIET
Blisterd be thy tongue
For such a wish He was not born to shame
Upon his brow shame is ashamd to sit
For tis a throne where honour may be crownd
Sole monarch of the universal earth
O what a beast was I to chide at him

NURSE
Will you speak well of him that killd your cousin

JULIET
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband
Ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
When I thy threehours wife have mangled it
But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
That villain cousin would have killd my husband
Back foolish tears back to your native spring
Your tributary drops belong to woe
Which you mistaking offer up to joy
My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain
And Tybalts dead that would have slain my husband
All this is comfort wherefore weep I then
Some word there was worser than Tybalts death
That murderd me I would forget it fain
But O it presses to my memory
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished
That banished that one word banished
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts Tybalts death
Was woe enough if it had ended there
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rankd with other griefs
Why followd not when she said Tybalts dead
Thy father or thy mother nay or both
Which modern lamentation might have movd
But with a rearward following Tybalts death
Romeo is banishedto speak that word
Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet
All slain all dead Romeo is banished
There is no end no limit measure bound
In that words death no words can that woe sound
Where is my father and my mother Nurse

NURSE
Weeping and wailing over Tybalts corse
Will you go to them I will bring you thither

JULIET
Wash they his wounds with tears Mine shall be spent
When theirs are dry for Romeos banishment
Take up those cords Poor ropes you are beguild
Both you and I for Romeo is exild
He made you for a highway to my bed
But I a maid die maidenwidowed
Come cords come Nurse Ill to my wedding bed
And death not Romeo take my maidenhead

NURSE
Hie to your chamber Ill find Romeo
To comfort you I wot well where he is
Hark ye your Romeo will be here at night
Ill to him he is hid at Lawrence cell

JULIET
O find him give this ring to my true knight
And bid him come to take his last farewell

 Exeunt

SCENE III Friar Lawrences cell

 Enter Friar Lawrence

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man
Affliction is enanmourd of thy parts
And thou art wedded to calamity

 Enter Romeo

ROMEO
Father what news What is the Princes doom
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
That I yet know not

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company
I bring thee tidings of the Princes doom

ROMEO
What less than doomsday is the Princes doom

FRIAR LAWRENCE
A gentler judgment vanishd from his lips
Not bodys death but bodys banishment

ROMEO
Ha banishment Be merciful say death
For exile hath more terror in his look
Much more than death Do not say banishment

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hence from Verona art thou banished
Be patient for the world is broad and wide

ROMEO
There is no world without Verona walls
But purgatory torture hell itself
Hence banished is banishd from the world
And worlds exile is death Then banished
Is death mistermd Calling death banished
Thou cuttst my head off with a golden axe
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me

FRIAR LAWRENCE
O deadly sin O rude unthankfulness
Thy fault our law calls death but the kind Prince
Taking thy part hath brushd aside the law
And turnd that black word death to banishment
This is dear mercy and thou seest it not

ROMEO
Tis torture and not mercy Heaven is here
Where Juliet lives and every cat and dog
And little mouse every unworthy thing
Live here in heaven and may look on her
But Romeo may not More validity
More honourable state more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo They may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliets hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips
Who even in pure and vestal modesty
Still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
But Romeo may not he is banished
This may flies do when I from this must fly
They are free men but I am banished
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death
Hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife
No sudden mean of death though neer so mean
But banished to kill me Banished
O Friar the damned use that word in hell
Howlings attends it How hast thou the heart
Being a divine a ghostly confessor
A sinabsolver and my friend professd
To mangle me with that word banished

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Thou fond mad man hear me speak a little

ROMEO
O thou wilt speak again of banishment

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Ill give thee armour to keep off that word
Adversitys sweet milk philosophy
To comfort thee though thou art banished

ROMEO
Yet banished Hang up philosophy
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet
Displant a town reverse a Princes doom
It helps not it prevails not talk no more

FRIAR LAWRENCE
O then I see that mad men have no ears

ROMEO
How should they when that wise men have no eyes

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate

ROMEO
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
Wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love
An hour but married Tybalt murdered
Doting like me and like me banished
Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
And fall upon the ground as I do now
Taking the measure of an unmade grave

 Knocking within

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Arise one knocks Good Romeo hide thyself

ROMEO
Not I unless the breath of heartsick groans
Mistlike infold me from the search of eyes

 Knocking

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hark how they knockWhos thereRomeo arise
Thou wilt be takenStay awhileStand up

 Knocking

Run to my studyByandbyGods will
What simpleness is thisI come I come

 Knocking

Who knocks so hard Whence come you whats your will

NURSE
Within Let me come in and you shall know my errand
I come from Lady Juliet

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Welcome then

 Enter Nurse

NURSE
O holy Friar O tell me holy Friar
Where is my ladys lord wheres Romeo

FRIAR LAWRENCE
There on the ground with his own tears made drunk

NURSE
O he is even in my mistress case
Just in her case O woeful sympathy
Piteous predicament Even so lies she
Blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
Stand up stand up stand and you be a man
For Juliets sake for her sake rise and stand
Why should you fall into so deep an O

ROMEO
Nurse

NURSE
Ah sir ah sir deaths the end of all

ROMEO
Spakest thou of Juliet How is it with her
Doth not she think me an old murderer
Now I have staind the childhood of our joy
With blood removd but little from her own
Where is she And how doth she And what says
My conceald lady to our cancelld love

NURSE
O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
And now falls on her bed and then starts up
And Tybalt calls and then on Romeo cries
And then down falls again

ROMEO
As if that name
Shot from the deadly level of a gun
Did murder her as that names cursed hand
Murderd her kinsman O tell me Friar tell me
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge Tell me that I may sack
The hateful mansion

 Drawing his sword

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hold thy desperate hand
Art thou a man Thy form cries out thou art
Thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast
Unseemly woman in a seeming man
And illbeseeming beast in seeming both
Thou hast amazd me By my holy order
I thought thy disposition better temperd
Hast thou slain Tybalt Wilt thou slay thyself
And slay thy lady that in thy life lives
By doing damned hate upon thyself
Why railst thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
Fie fie thou shamst thy shape thy love thy wit
Which like a usurer aboundst in all
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
Digressing from the valour of a man
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
Killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish
Thy wit that ornament to shape and love
Misshapen in the conduct of them both
Like powder in a skilless soldiers flask
Is set afire by thine own ignorance
And thou dismemberd with thine own defence
What rouse thee man Thy Juliet is alive
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
There art thou happy Tybalt would kill thee
But thou slewst Tybalt there art thou happy
The law that threatend death becomes thy friend
And turns it to exile there art thou happy
A pack of blessings light upon thy back
Happiness courts thee in her best array
But like a misshaped and sullen wench
Thou puttst up thy Fortune and thy love
Take heed take heed for such die miserable
Go get thee to thy love as was decreed
Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
But look thou stay not till the watch be set
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
Beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou wentst forth in lamentation
Go before Nurse Commend me to thy lady
And bid her hasten all the house to bed
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
Romeo is coming

NURSE
O Lord I could have stayd here all the night
To hear good counsel O what learning is
My lord Ill tell my lady you will come

ROMEO
Do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide

NURSE
Here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
Hie you make haste for it grows very late

 Exit

ROMEO
How well my comfort is revivd by this

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Go hence good night and here stands all your state
Either be gone before the watch be set
Or by the break of day disguisd from hence
Sojourn in Mantua Ill find out your man
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here
Give me thy hand tis late farewell good night

ROMEO
But that a joy past joy calls out on me
It were a grief so brief to part with thee
Farewell

 Exeunt

Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed
Prepare her wife against this wedding day
Farewell my lordLight to my chamber ho
Afore me it is so very very late that we
May call it early by and by Good night

 Exeunt

SCENE V An open Gallery to Juliets Chamber overlooking the Garden

 Enter Romeo and Juliet

JULIET
Wilt thou be gone It is not yet near day
It was the nightingale and not the lark
That piercd the fearful hollow of thine ear
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree
Believe me love it was the nightingale

ROMEO
It was the lark the herald of the morn
No nightingale Look love what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
Nights candles are burnt out and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
I must be gone and live or stay and die

JULIET
Yond light is not daylight I know it I
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
To be to thee this night a torchbearer
And light thee on thy way to Mantua
Therefore stay yet thou needst not to be gone

ROMEO
Let me be taen let me be put to death
I am content so thou wilt have it so
Ill say yon grey is not the mornings eye
Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthias brow
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads
I have more care to stay than will to go
Come death and welcome Juliet wills it so
How ist my soul Lets talk It is not day

JULIET
It is it is Hie hence be gone away
It is the lark that sings so out of tune
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
Some say the lark makes sweet division
This doth not so for she divideth us
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
O now I would they had changd voices too
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
Hunting thee hence with huntsup to the day
O now be gone more light and light it grows

ROMEO
More light and light more dark and dark our woes

 Enter Nurse

NURSE
Madam

JULIET
Nurse

NURSE
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber
The day is broke be wary look about

 Exit

JULIET
Then window let day in and let life out

ROMEO
Farewell farewell one kiss and Ill descend

 Descends

JULIET
Art thou gone so Love lord ay husband friend
I must hear from thee every day in the hour
For in a minute there are many days
O by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo

ROMEO
Farewell
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings love to thee

JULIET
O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again

ROMEO
I doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come

JULIET
O God I have an illdivining soul
Methinks I see thee now thou art so low
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb
Either my eyesight fails or thou lookst pale

ROMEO
And trust me love in my eye so do you
Dry sorrow drinks our blood Adieu adieu

 Exit below

JULIET
O Fortune Fortune All men call thee fickle
If thou art fickle what dost thou with him
That is renownd for faith Be fickle Fortune
For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
But send him back

LADY CAPULET
Within Ho daughter are you up

JULIET
Who ist that calls Is it my lady mother
Is she not down so late or up so early
What unaccustomd cause procures her hither

 Enter Lady Capulet

LADY CAPULET
Why how now Juliet

JULIET
Madam I am not well

LADY CAPULET
Evermore weeping for your cousins death
What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
And if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
Therefore have done some grief shows much of love
But much of grief shows still some want of wit

JULIET
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss

LADY CAPULET
So shall you feel the loss but not the friend
Which you weep for

JULIET
Feeling so the loss
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend

LADY CAPULET
Well girl thou weepst not so much for his death
As that the villain lives which slaughterd him

JULIET
What villain madam

LADY CAPULET
That same villain Romeo

JULIET
Villain and he be many miles asunder
God pardon him I do with all my heart
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart

LADY CAPULET
That is because the traitor murderer lives

JULIET
Ay madam from the reach of these my hands
Would none but I might venge my cousins death

LADY CAPULET
We will have vengeance for it fear thou not
Then weep no more Ill send to one in Mantua
Where that same banishd runagate doth live
Shall give him such an unaccustomd dram
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied

JULIET
Indeed I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo till I behold himdead
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vexd
Madam if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison I would temper it
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof
Soon sleep in quiet O how my heart abhors
To hear him namd and cannot come to him
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that hath slaughterd him

LADY CAPULET
Find thou the means and Ill find such a man
But now Ill tell thee joyful tidings girl

JULIET
And joy comes well in such a needy time
What are they I beseech your ladyship

LADY CAPULET
Well well thou hast a careful father child
One who to put thee from thy heaviness
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
That thou expects not nor I lookd not for

JULIET
Madam in happy time what day is that

LADY CAPULET
Marry my child early next Thursday morn
The gallant young and noble gentleman
The County Paris at Saint Peters Church
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride

JULIET
Now by Saint Peters Church and Peter too
He shall not make me there a joyful bride
I wonder at this haste that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo
I pray you tell my lord and father madam
I will not marry yet and when I do I swear
It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate
Rather than Paris These are news indeed

LADY CAPULET
Here comes your father tell him so yourself
And see how he will take it at your hands

 Enter Capulet and Nurse

CAPULET
When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew
But for the sunset of my brothers son
It rains downright
How now A conduit girl What still in tears
Evermore showering In one little body
Thou counterfeits a bark a sea a wind
For still thy eyes which I may call the sea
Do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
Sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
Who raging with thy tears and they with them
Without a sudden calm will overset
Thy tempesttossed body How now wife
Have you deliverd to her our decree

LADY CAPULET
Ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks
I would the fool were married to her grave

CAPULET
Soft Take me with you take me with you wife
How will she none Doth she not give us thanks
Is she not proud Doth she not count her blest
Unworthy as she is that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom

JULIET
Not proud you have but thankful that you have
Proud can I never be of what I hate
But thankful even for hate that is meant love

CAPULET
How now how now choppd logic What is this
Proud and I thank you and I thank you not
And yet not proud Mistress minion you
Thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds
But fettle your fine joints gainst Thursday next
To go with Paris to Saint Peters Church
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither
Out you greensickness carrion Out you baggage
You tallowface

LADY CAPULET
Fie fie What are you mad

JULIET
Good father I beseech you on my knees
Hear me with patience but to speak a word

CAPULET
Hang thee young baggage disobedient wretch
I tell thee whatget thee to church a Thursday
Or never after look me in the face
Speak not reply not do not answer me
My fingers itch Wife we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child
But now I see this one is one too much
And that we have a curse in having her
Out on her hilding

NURSE
God in heaven bless her
You are to blame my lord to rate her so

CAPULET
And why my lady wisdom Hold your tongue
Good prudence smatter with your gossips go

NURSE
I speak no treason

CAPULET
O God ye gooden

NURSE

CAPULET
Peace you mumbling fool
Utter your gravity oer a gossips bowl
For here we need it not

LADY CAPULET
You are too hot

CAPULET
Gods bread it makes me mad
Day night hour ride time work play
Alone in company still my care hath been
To have her matchd and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage
Of fair demesnes youthful and nobly allied
Stuffd as they say with honourable parts
Proportiond as ones thought would wish a man
And then to have a wretched puling fool
A whining mammet in her fortunes tender
To answer Ill not wed I cannot love
I am too young I pray you pardon me
But and you will not wed Ill pardon you
Graze where you will you shall not house with me
Look tot think ont I do not use to jest
Thursday is near lay hand on heart advise
And you be mine Ill give you to my friend
And you be not hang beg starve die in the streets
For by my soul Ill neer acknowledge thee
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good
Trust tot bethink you Ill not be forsworn

 Exit

JULIET
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
That sees into the bottom of my grief
O sweet my mother cast me not away
Delay this marriage for a month a week
Or if you do not make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies

LADY CAPULET
Talk not to me for Ill not speak a word
Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee

 Exit

JULIET
O God O Nurse how shall this be prevented
My husband is on earth my faith in heaven
How shall that faith return again to earth
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth Comfort me counsel me
Alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself
What sayst thou Hast thou not a word of joy
Some comfort Nurse

NURSE
Faith here it is
Romeo is banished and all the world to nothing
That he dares neer come back to challenge you
Or if he do it needs must be by stealth
Then since the case so stands as now it doth
I think it best you married with the County
O hes a lovely gentleman
Romeos a dishclout to him An eagle madam
Hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
As Paris hath Beshrew my very heart
I think you are happy in this second match
For it excels your first or if it did not
Your first is dead or twere as good he were
As living here and you no use of him

JULIET
Speakest thou from thy heart

NURSE
And from my soul too
Or else beshrew them both

JULIET
Amen

NURSE
What

JULIET
Well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
Go in and tell my lady I am gone
Having displeasd my father to Lawrence cell
To make confession and to be absolvd

NURSE
Marry I will and this is wisely done

 Exit

JULIET
Ancient damnation O most wicked fiend
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praisd him with above compare
So many thousand times Go counsellor
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
Ill to the Friar to know his remedy
If all else fail myself have power to die

 Exit



ACT IV

SCENE I Friar Lawrences Cell

 Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris

FRIAR LAWRENCE
On Thursday sir The time is very short

PARIS
My father Capulet will have it so
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste

FRIAR LAWRENCE
You say you do not know the ladys mind
Uneven is the course I like it not

PARIS
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalts death
And therefore have I little talkd of love
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears
Now sir her father counts it dangerous
That she do give her sorrow so much sway
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
To stop the inundation of her tears
Which too much minded by herself alone
May be put from her by society
Now do you know the reason of this haste

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Aside I would I knew not why it should be slowd
Look sir here comes the lady toward my cell

 Enter Juliet

PARIS
Happily met my lady and my wife

JULIET
That may be sir when I may be a wife

PARIS
That may be must be love on Thursday next

JULIET
What must be shall be

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Thats a certain text

PARIS
Come you to make confession to this father

JULIET
To answer that I should confess to you

PARIS
Do not deny to him that you love me

JULIET
I will confess to you that I love him

PARIS
So will ye I am sure that you love me

JULIET
If I do so it will be of more price
Being spoke behind your back than to your face

PARIS
Poor soul thy face is much abusd with tears

JULIET
The tears have got small victory by that
For it was bad enough before their spite

PARIS
Thou wrongst it more than tears with that report

JULIET
That is no slander sir which is a truth
And what I spake I spake it to my face

PARIS
Thy face is mine and thou hast slanderd it

JULIET
It may be so for it is not mine own
Are you at leisure holy father now
Or shall I come to you at evening mass

FRIAR LAWRENCE
My leisure serves me pensive daughter now
My lord we must entreat the time alone

PARIS
God shield I should disturb devotion
Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye
Till then adieu and keep this holy kiss

 Exit

JULIET
O shut the door and when thou hast done so
Come weep with me past hope past cure past help

FRIAR LAWRENCE
O Juliet I already know thy grief
It strains me past the compass of my wits
I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
On Thursday next be married to this County

JULIET
Tell me not Friar that thou hearst of this
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
Do thou but call my resolution wise
And with this knife Ill help it presently
God joind my heart and Romeos thou our hands
And ere this hand by thee to Romeos seald
Shall be the label to another deed
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another this shall slay them both
Therefore out of thy longexperiencd time
Give me some present counsel or behold
Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the empire arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring
Be not so long to speak I long to die
If what thou speakst speak not of remedy

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hold daughter I do spy a kind of hope
Which craves as desperate an execution
As that is desperate which we would prevent
If rather than to marry County Paris
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame
That copst with death himself to scape from it
And if thou darst Ill give thee remedy

JULIET
O bid me leap rather than marry Paris
From off the battlements of yonder tower
Or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
Where serpents are Chain me with roaring bears
Or hide me nightly in a charnelhouse
Oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
Or bid me go into a newmade grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud
Things that to hear them told have made me tremble
And I will do it without fear or doubt
To live an unstaind wife to my sweet love

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hold then Go home be merry give consent
To marry Paris Wednesday is tomorrow
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
Take thou this vial being then in bed
And this distilled liquor drink thou off
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress but surcease
No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
Like death when he shuts up the day of life
Each part deprivd of supple government
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
And in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
Then as the manner of our country is
In thy best robes uncoverd on the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie
In the meantime against thou shalt awake
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift
And hither shall he come and he and I
Will watch thy waking and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua
And this shall free thee from this present shame
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
Abate thy valour in the acting it

JULIET
Give me give me O tell not me of fear

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
In this resolve Ill send a friar with speed
To Mantua with my letters to thy lord

JULIET
Love give me strength and strength shall help afford
Farewell dear father

 Enter Juliet

NURSE
See where she comes from shrift with merry look

CAPULET
How now my headstrong Where have you been gadding

JULIET
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests and am enjoind
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here
To beg your pardon Pardon I beseech you
Henceforward I am ever ruld by you

CAPULET
Send for the County go tell him of this
Ill have this knot knit up tomorrow morning

JULIET
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence cell
And gave him what becomed love I might
Not stepping oer the bounds of modesty

CAPULET
Why I am glad ont This is well Stand up
This is ast should be Let me see the County
Ay marry Go I say and fetch him hither
Now afore God this reverend holy Friar
All our whole city is much bound to him

Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimd

 Exeunt

SCENE III Juliets Chamber

 Enter Juliet and Nurse

JULIET
Ay those attires are best But gentle Nurse
I pray thee leave me to myself tonight
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state
Which well thou knowst is cross and full of sin

 Enter Lady Capulet

LADY CAPULET
What are you busy ho Need you my help

JULIET
No madam we have culld such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state tomorrow
So please you let me now be left alone
And let the nurse this night sit up with you
For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business

LADY CAPULET
Good night
Get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need

 Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse

JULIET
Farewell God knows when we shall meet again
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life
Ill call them back again to comfort me
NurseWhat should she do here
My dismal scene I needs must act alone
Come vial
What if this mixture do not work at all
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning
No No This shall forbid it Lie thou there

 Laying down her dagger

What if it be a poison which the Friar
Subtly hath ministerd to have me dead
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd
Because he married me before to Romeo
I fear it is And yet methinks it should not
For he hath still been tried a holy man
How if when I am laid into the tomb
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me Theres a fearful point
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes
Or if I live is it not very like
The horrible conceit of death and night
Together with the terror of the place
As in a vault an ancient receptacle
Where for this many hundred years the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packd
Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth
Lies festering in his shroud where as they say
At some hours in the night spirits resort
Alack alack is it not like that I
So early waking what with loathsome smells
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
That living mortals hearing them run mad
O if I wake shall I not be distraught
Environed with all these hideous fears
And madly play with my forefathers joints
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud
And in this rage with some great kinsmans bone
As with a club dash out my desperate brains
O look methinks I see my cousins ghost
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
Upon a rapiers point Stay Tybalt stay
Romeo Romeo Romeo heres drink I drink to thee

 Throws herself on the bed

Beguild divorced wronged spited slain
Most detestable death by thee beguild
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown
O love O life Not life but love in death

CAPULET
Despisd distressed hated martyrd killd
Uncomfortable time why camst thou now
To murder murder our solemnity
O child O child My soul and not my child
Dead art thou Alack my child is dead
And with my child my joys are buried

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Peace ho for shame Confusions cure lives not
In these confusions Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all
And all the better is it for the maid
Your part in her you could not keep from death
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life
The most you sought was her promotion
For twas your heaven she should be advancd
And weep ye now seeing she is advancd
Above the clouds as high as heaven itself
O in this love you love your child so ill
That you run mad seeing that she is well
Shes not well married that lives married long
But shes best married that dies married young
Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse and as the custom is
And in her best array bear her to church
For though fond nature bids us all lament
Yet natures tears are reasons merriment

CAPULET
All things that we ordained festival
Turn from their office to black funeral
Our instruments to melancholy bells
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse
And all things change them to the contrary

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Sir go you in and madam go with him
And go Sir Paris everyone prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill
Move them no more by crossing their high will

ACT V

SCENE I Mantua A Street

 Enter Romeo

ROMEO
If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
My bosoms lord sits lightly in his throne
And all this day an unaccustomd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think
And breathd such life with kisses in my lips
That I revivd and was an emperor
Ah me how sweet is love itself possessd
When but loves shadows are so rich in joy

 Enter Balthasar

News from Verona How now Balthasar
Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar
How doth my lady Is my father well
How fares my Juliet That I ask again
For nothing can be ill if she be well

BALTHASAR
Then she is well and nothing can be ill
Her body sleeps in Capels monument
And her immortal part with angels lives
I saw her laid low in her kindreds vault
And presently took post to tell it you
O pardon me for bringing these ill news
Since you did leave it for my office sir

ROMEO
Is it even so Then I defy you stars
Thou knowst my lodging Get me ink and paper
And hire posthorses I will hence tonight

BALTHASAR
I do beseech you sir have patience
Your looks are pale and wild and do import
Some misadventure

ROMEO
Tush thou art deceivd
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar

BALTHASAR
No my good lord

ROMEO
No matter Get thee gone
And hire those horses Ill be with thee straight

 Exit Balthasar

Well Juliet I will lie with thee tonight
Lets see for means O mischief thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men
I do remember an apothecary
And hereabouts he dwellswhich late I noted
In tatterd weeds with overwhelming brows
Culling of simples meagre were his looks
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung
An alligator stuffd and other skins
Of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes
Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
Were thinly scatterd to make up a show
Noting this penury to myself I said
And if a man did need a poison now
Whose sale is present death in Mantua
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
O this same thought did but forerun my need
And this same needy man must sell it me
As I remember this should be the house
Being holiday the beggars shop is shut
What ho Apothecary

 Enter Apothecary

APOTHECARY
Who calls so loud

ROMEO
Come hither man I see that thou art poor
Hold there is forty ducats Let me have
A dram of poison such soonspeeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the lifeweary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be dischargd of breath
As violently as hasty powder fird
Doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb

APOTHECARY
Such mortal drugs I have but Mantuas law
Is death to any he that utters them

ROMEO
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
And fearst to die Famine is in thy cheeks
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
The world is not thy friend nor the worlds law
The world affords no law to make thee rich
Then be not poor but break it and take this

APOTHECARY
My poverty but not my will consents

ROMEO
I pay thy poverty and not thy will

APOTHECARY
Put this in any liquid thing you will
And drink it off and if you had the strength
Of twenty men it would despatch you straight

ROMEO
There is thy gold worse poison to mens souls
Doing more murder in this loathsome world
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
I sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
Farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
Come cordial and not poison go with me
To Juliets grave for there must I use thee

 Exeunt

SCENE II Friar Lawrences Cell

 Enter Friar John

FRIAR JOHN
Holy Franciscan Friar Brother ho

 Enter Friar Lawrence

FRIAR LAWRENCE
This same should be the voice of Friar John
Welcome from Mantua What says Romeo
Or if his mind be writ give me his letter

FRIAR JOHN
Going to find a barefoot brother out
One of our order to associate me
Here in this city visiting the sick
And finding him the searchers of the town
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign
Seald up the doors and would not let us forth
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayd

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Who bare my letter then to Romeo

FRIAR JOHN
I could not send ithere it is again
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee
So fearful were they of infection

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Unhappy fortune By my brotherhood
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of dear import and the neglecting it
May do much danger Friar John go hence
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
Unto my cell

FRIAR JOHN
Brother Ill go and bring it thee

 Exit

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Now must I to the monument alone
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents
But I will write again to Mantua
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come
Poor living corse closd in a dead mans tomb

 Exit

SCENE III A churchyard in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets

 Enter Paris and his Page bearing flowers and a torch

PARIS
Give me thy torch boy Hence and stand aloof
Yet put it out for I would not be seen
Under yond yew tree lay thee all along
Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
Being loose unfirm with digging up of graves
But thou shalt hear it Whistle then to me
As signal that thou hearst something approach
Give me those flowers Do as I bid thee go

PAGE
Aside I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard yet I will adventure

 Retires

PARIS
Sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
O woe thy canopy is dust and stones
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew
Or wanting that with tears distilld by moans
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep

 The Page whistles

The boy gives warning something doth approach
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight
To cross my obsequies and true loves rite
What with a torch Muffle me night awhile

 Retires

 Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch mattock c

ROMEO
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
Hold take this letter early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father
Give me the light upon thy life I charge thee
Whateer thou hearst or seest stand all aloof
And do not interrupt me in my course
Why I descend into this bed of death
Is partly to behold my ladys face
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring a ring that I must use
In dear employment Therefore hence be gone
But if thou jealous dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
The time and my intents are savagewild
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea

BALTHASAR
I will be gone sir and not trouble you

ROMEO
So shalt thou show me friendship Take thou that
Live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow

BALTHASAR
For all this same Ill hide me hereabout
His looks I fear and his intents I doubt

 Retires

ROMEO
Thou detestable maw thou womb of death
Gorgd with the dearest morsel of the earth
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open

 Breaking open the door of the monument

And in despite Ill cram thee with more food

PARIS
This is that banishd haughty Montague
That murderd my loves cousinwith which grief
It is supposed the fair creature died
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies I will apprehend him

 Advances

Stop thy unhallowd toil vile Montague
Can vengeance be pursud further than death
Condemned villain I do apprehend thee
Obey and go with me for thou must die

ROMEO
I must indeed and therefore came I hither
Good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
Fly hence and leave me Think upon these gone
Let them affright thee I beseech thee youth
Put not another sin upon my head
By urging me to fury O be gone
By heaven I love thee better than myself
For I come hither armd against myself
Stay not be gone live and hereafter say
A madmans mercy bid thee run away

PARIS
I do defy thy conjuration
And apprehend thee for a felon here

ROMEO
Wilt thou provoke me Then have at thee boy

 They fight

PAGE
O lord they fight I will go call the watch

 Exit

PARIS
O I am slain Falls If thou be merciful
Open the tomb lay me with Juliet

 Dies

ROMEO
In faith I will Let me peruse this face
Mercutios kinsman noble County Paris
What said my man when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet
Said he not so Or did I dream it so
Or am I mad hearing him talk of Juliet
To think it was so O give me thy hand
One writ with me in sour misfortunes book
Ill bury thee in a triumphant grave
A grave O no a lantern slaughtred youth
For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light
Death lie thou there by a dead man interrd

 Laying Paris in the monument

How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry Which their keepers call
A lightning before death O how may I
Call this a lightning O my love my wife
Death that hath suckd the honey of thy breath
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
Thou art not conquerd Beautys ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
And deaths pale flag is not advanced there
Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
O what more favour can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy
Forgive me cousin Ah dear Juliet
Why art thou yet so fair Shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour
For fear of that I still will stay with thee
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again Here here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids O here
Will I set up my everlasting rest
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this worldwearied flesh Eyes look your last
Arms take your last embrace And lips O you
The doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death
Come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
Thou desperate pilot now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
Heres to my love Drinks O true apothecary
Thy drugs are quick Thus with a kiss I die

 Dies

 Enter at the other end of the Churchyard Friar Lawrence with a
 lantern crow and spade

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Saint Francis be my speed How oft tonight
Have my old feet stumbled at graves Whos there
Who is it that consorts so late the dead

BALTHASAR
Heres one a friend and one that knows you well

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Bliss be upon you Tell me good my friend
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls As I discern
It burneth in the Capels monument

BALTHASAR
It doth so holy sir and theres my master
One that you love

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Who is it

BALTHASAR
Romeo

FRIAR LAWRENCE
How long hath he been there

BALTHASAR
Full half an hour

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Go with me to the vault

BALTHASAR
I dare not sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence
And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Stay then Ill go alone Fear comes upon me
O much I fear some ill unlucky thing

BALTHASAR
As I did sleep under this yew tree here
I dreamt my master and another fought
And that my master slew him

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Romeo Advances
Alack alack what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolourd by this place of peace

 Enters the monument

Romeo O pale Who else What Paris too
And steepd in blood Ah what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance
The lady stirs

 Juliet wakes and stirs

JULIET
O comfortable Friar where is my lord
I do remember well where I should be
And there I am Where is my Romeo

 Noise within

FRIAR LAWRENCE
I hear some noise Lady come from that nest
Of death contagion and unnatural sleep
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents Come come away
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead
And Paris too Come Ill dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns
Stay not to question for the watch is coming
Come go good Juliet I dare no longer stay

JULIET
Go get thee hence for I will not away

 Exit Friar Lawrence

Whats here A cup closd in my true loves hand
Poison I see hath been his timeless end
O churl Drink all and left no friendly drop
To help me after I will kiss thy lips
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
To make me die with a restorative

 Kisses him

Thy lips are warm

FIRST WATCH
Within Lead boy Which way

JULIET
Yea noise Then Ill be brief O happy dagger

 Snatching Romeos dagger

This is thy sheath stabs herself There rest and let me die

 Falls on Romeos body and dies

 Enter Watch with the Page of Paris

PAGE
This is the place There where the torch doth burn

FIRST WATCH
The ground is bloody Search about the churchyard
Go some of you whoeer you find attach

 Exeunt some of the Watch

Pitiful sight Here lies the County slain
And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead
Who here hath lain this two days buried
Go tell the Prince run to the Capulets
Raise up the Montagues some others search

 Exeunt others of the Watch

We see the ground whereon these woes do lie
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry

 Reenter some of the Watch with Balthasar

SECOND WATCH
Heres Romeos man We found him in the churchyard

FIRST WATCH
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither

 Reenter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence

THIRD WATCH Here is a Friar that trembles sighs and weeps
We took this mattock and this spade from him
As he was coming from this churchyard side

FIRST WATCH
A great suspicion Stay the Friar too

 Enter the Prince and Attendants

PRINCE
What misadventure is so early up
That calls our person from our mornings rest

 Enter Capulet Lady Capulet and others

CAPULET
What should it be that they so shriek abroad

LADY CAPULET
O the people in the street cry Romeo
Some Juliet and some Paris and all run
With open outcry toward our monument

PRINCE
What fear is this which startles in our ears

FIRST WATCH
Sovereign here lies the County Paris slain
And Romeo dead and Juliet dead before
Warm and new killd

PRINCE
Search seek and know how this foul murder comes

FIRST WATCH
Here is a Friar and slaughterd Romeos man
With instruments upon them fit to open
These dead mens tombs

CAPULET
O heaven O wife look how our daughter bleeds
This dagger hath mistaen for lo his house
Is empty on the back of Montague
And it missheathed in my daughters bosom

LADY CAPULET
O me This sight of death is as a bell
That warns my old age to a sepulchre

 Enter Montague and others

PRINCE
Come Montague for thou art early up
To see thy son and heir more early down

MONTAGUE
Alas my liege my wife is dead tonight
Grief of my sons exile hath stoppd her breath
What further woe conspires against mine age

PRINCE
Look and thou shalt see

MONTAGUE
O thou untaught What manners is in this
To press before thy father to a grave

PRINCE
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
Till we can clear these ambiguities
And know their spring their head their true descent
And then will I be general of your woes
And lead you even to death Meantime forbear
And let mischance be slave to patience
Bring forth the parties of suspicion

FRIAR LAWRENCE
I am the greatest able to do least
Yet most suspected as the time and place
Doth make against me of this direful murder
And here I stand both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excusd

PRINCE
Then say at once what thou dost know in this

FRIAR LAWRENCE
I will be brief for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale
Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet
And she there dead that Romeos faithful wife
I married them and their stoln marriage day
Was Tybalts doomsday whose untimely death
Banishd the newmade bridegroom from this city
For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pind
You to remove that siege of grief from her
Betrothd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris Then comes she to me
And with wild looks bid me devise some means
To rid her from this second marriage
Or in my cell there would she kill herself
Then gave I her so tutored by my art
A sleeping potion which so took effect
As I intended for it wrought on her
The form of death Meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night
To help to take her from her borrowd grave
Being the time the potions force should cease
But he which bore my letter Friar John
Was stayd by accident and yesternight
Returnd my letter back Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking
Came I to take her from her kindreds vault
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo
But when I came some minute ere the time
Of her awaking here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead
She wakes and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb
And she too desperate would not go with me
But as it seems did violence on herself
All this I know and to the marriage
Her Nurse is privy And if ought in this
Miscarried by my fault let my old life
Be sacrificd some hour before his time
Unto the rigour of severest law

PRINCE
We still have known thee for a holy man
Wheres Romeos man What can he say to this

BALTHASAR
I brought my master news of Juliets death
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place to this same monument
This letter he early bid me give his father
And threatend me with death going in the vault
If I departed not and left him there

PRINCE
Give me the letter I will look on it
Where is the Countys Page that raisd the watch
Sirrah what made your master in this place

PAGE
He came with flowers to strew his ladys grave
And bid me stand aloof and so I did
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
And by and by my master drew on him
And then I ran away to call the watch

PRINCE
This letter doth make good the Friars words
Their course of love the tidings of her death
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor pothecary and therewithal
Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet
Where be these enemies Capulet Montague
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen All are punishd

CAPULET
O brother Montague give me thy hand
This is my daughters jointure for no more
Can I demand

MONTAGUE
But I can give thee more
For I will raise her statue in pure gold
That whiles Verona by that name is known
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet

CAPULET
As rich shall Romeos by his ladys lie
Poor sacrifices of our enmity

PRINCE
A glooming peace this morning with it brings
The sun for sorrow will not show his head
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things
Some shall be pardond and some punished
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo

 Exeunt

ACT I

SCENE I Elsinore A platform before the Castle

 Enter Francisco and Barnardo two sentinels

BARNARDO Whos there

FRANCISCO Nay answer me Stand and unfold yourself

BARNARDO Long live the King

FRANCISCO Barnardo

BARNARDO He

FRANCISCO You come most carefully upon your hour

BARNARDO Tis now struck twelve Get thee to bed Francisco

FRANCISCO For this relief much thanks Tis bitter cold And I am sick
at heart

BARNARDO Have you had quiet guard

FRANCISCO Not a mouse stirring

BARNARDO Well good night If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus The
rivals of my watch bid them make haste

 Enter Horatio and Marcellus

FRANCISCO I think I hear them Stand ho Who is there

HORATIO Friends to this ground

MARCELLUS And liegemen to the Dane

FRANCISCO Give you good night

MARCELLUS O farewell honest soldier who hath relievd you

FRANCISCO Barnardo has my place Give you goodnight

 Exit

MARCELLUS Holla Barnardo

BARNARDO Say what is Horatio there

HORATIO A piece of him

BARNARDO Welcome Horatio Welcome good Marcellus

MARCELLUS What has this thing appeard again tonight

BARNARDO I have seen nothing

MARCELLUS Horatio says tis but our fantasy And will not let belief
take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of
this night That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes
and speak to it

HORATIO Tush tush twill not appear

BARNARDO Sit down awhile And let us once again assail your ears That
are so fortified against our story What we two nights have seen

HORATIO Well sit we down And let us hear Barnardo speak of this

BARNARDO Last night of all When yond same star thats westward from
the pole Had made his course tillume that part of heaven Where now it
burns Marcellus and myself The bell then beating one

MARCELLUS Peace break thee off Look where it comes again

 Enter Ghost

BARNARDO In the same figure like the King thats dead

MARCELLUS Thou art a scholar speak to it Horatio

BARNARDO Looks it not like the King Mark it Horatio

HORATIO Most like It harrows me with fear and wonder

BARNARDO It would be spoke to

MARCELLUS Question it Horatio

HORATIO What art thou that usurpst this time of night Together with
that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did
sometimes march By heaven I charge thee speak

MARCELLUS It is offended

BARNARDO See it stalks away

HORATIO Stay speak speak I charge thee speak

 Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS Tis gone and will not answer

BARNARDO How now Horatio You tremble and look pale Is not this
something more than fantasy What think you ont

HORATIO Before my God I might not this believe Without the sensible
and true avouch Of mine own eyes

MARCELLUS Is it not like the King

HORATIO As thou art to thyself Such was the very armour he had on
When he thambitious Norway combated So frownd he once when in an
angry parle He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice Tis strange

MARCELLUS Thus twice before and jump at this dead hour With martial
stalk hath he gone by our watch

HORATIO In what particular thought to work I know not But in the
gross and scope of my opinion This bodes some strange eruption to our
state

MARCELLUS Good now sit down and tell me he that knows Why this
same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of
the land And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for
implements of war Why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week What might be toward that
this sweaty haste Doth make the night jointlabourer with the day Who
ist that can inform me

HORATIO That can I At least the whisper goes so Our last King
Whose image even but now appeard to us Was as you know by
Fortinbras of Norway Thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride Dard
to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet For so this side of our
known world esteemd him Did slay this Fortinbras who by a seald
compact Well ratified by law and heraldry Did forfeit with his life
all those his lands Which he stood seizd of to the conqueror Against
the which a moiety competent Was gaged by our King which had returnd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras Had he been vanquisher as by the
same covnant And carriage of the article designd His fell to Hamlet
Now sir young Fortinbras Of unimproved mettle hot and full Hath in
the skirts of Norway here and there Sharkd up a list of lawless
resolutes For food and diet to some enterprise That hath a stomach
int which is no other As it doth well appear unto our state But to
recover of us by strong hand And terms compulsatory those foresaid
lands So by his father lost And this I take it Is the main motive of
our preparations The source of this our watch and the chief head Of
this posthaste and rummage in the land

BARNARDO I think it be no other but een so Well may it sort that
this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the King
That was and is the question of these wars

HORATIO A mote it is to trouble the minds eye In the most high and
palmy state of Rome A little ere the mightiest Julius fell The graves
stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the
Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
Disasters in the sun and the moist star Upon whose influence
Neptunes empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse And
even the like precurse of fierce events As harbingers preceding still
the fates And prologue to the omen coming on Have heaven and earth
together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen

 Reenter Ghost

But soft behold Lo where it comes again Ill cross it though it
blast me Stay illusion If thou hast any sound or use of voice
Speak to me If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do
ease and grace to me Speak to me If thou art privy to thy countrys
fate Which happily foreknowing may avoid O speak Or if thou hast
uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth For
which they say you spirits oft walk in death Speak of it Stay and
speak

 The cock crows

Stop it Marcellus

MARCELLUS Shall I strike at it with my partisan

HORATIO Do if it will not stand

BARNARDO Tis here

HORATIO Tis here

 Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS Tis gone We do it wrong being so majestical To offer it
the show of violence For it is as the air invulnerable And our vain
blows malicious mockery

BARNARDO It was about to speak when the cock crew

HORATIO And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful
summons I have heard The cock that is the trumpet to the morn Doth
with his lofty and shrillsounding throat Awake the god of day and at
his warning Whether in sea or fire in earth or air Thextravagant
and erring spirit hies To his confine And of the truth herein This
present object made probation

MARCELLUS It faded on the crowing of the cock Some say that ever
gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviours birth is celebrated
The bird of dawning singeth all night long And then they say no
spirit dare stir abroad The nights are wholesome then no planets
strike No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm So hallowd and
so gracious is the time

HORATIO So have I heard and do in part believe it But look the morn
in russet mantle clad Walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill
Break we our watch up and by my advice Let us impart what we have
seen tonight Unto young Hamlet for upon my life This spirit dumb to
us will speak to him Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it As
needful in our loves fitting our duty

MARCELLUS Lets dot I pray and I this morning know Where we shall
find him most conveniently

 Exeunt

SCENE II Elsinore A room of state in the Castle

 Enter Claudius King of Denmark Gertrude the Queen Hamlet Polonius
 Laertes Voltemand Cornelius Lords and Attendant

KING Though yet of Hamlet our dear brothers death The memory be
green and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief and our
whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe Yet so far hath
discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him
Together with remembrance of ourselves Therefore our sometime sister
now our queen Thimperial jointress to this warlike state Have we as
twere with a defeated joy With one auspicious and one dropping eye
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage In equal scale
weighing delight and dole Taken to wife nor have we herein barrd
Your better wisdoms which have freely gone With this affair along For
all our thanks Now follows that you know young Fortinbras Holding a
weak supposal of our worth Or thinking by our late dear brothers
death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame Colleagued with this
dream of his advantage He hath not faild to pester us with message
Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father with all
bonds of law To our most valiant brother So much for him Now for
ourself and for this time of meeting Thus much the business is we
have here writ To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras Who impotent and
bedrid scarcely hears Of this his nephews purpose to suppress His
further gait herein in that the levies The lists and full
proportions are all made Out of his subject and we here dispatch You
good Cornelius and you Voltemand For bearers of this greeting to old
Norway Giving to you no further personal power To business with the
King more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow Farewell
and let your haste commend your duty

CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND In that and all things will we show our
duty

KING We doubt it nothing heartily farewell

 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius

And now Laertes whats the news with you You told us of some suit
What ist Laertes You cannot speak of reason to the Dane And lose
your voice What wouldst thou beg Laertes That shall not be my offer
not thy asking The head is not more native to the heart The hand more
instrumental to the mouth Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father
What wouldst thou have Laertes

LAERTES Dread my lord Your leave and favour to return to France From
whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your
coronation Yet now I must confess that duty done My thoughts and
wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave
and pardon

KING Have you your fathers leave What says Polonius

POLONIUS He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome
petition and at last Upon his will I seald my hard consent I do
beseech you give him leave to go

KING Take thy fair hour Laertes time be thine And thy best graces
spend it at thy will But now my cousin Hamlet and my son

HAMLET Aside A little more than kin and less than kind

KING How is it that the clouds still hang on you

HAMLET Not so my lord I am too much i the sun

QUEEN Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off And let thine eye look
like a friend on Denmark Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for
thy noble father in the dust Thou knowst tis common all that lives
must die Passing through nature to eternity

HAMLET Ay madam it is common

QUEEN If it be Why seems it so particular with thee

HAMLET Seems madam Nay it is I know not seems Tis not alone my
inky cloak good mother Nor customary suits of solemn black Nor windy
suspiration of forcd breath No nor the fruitful river in the eye
Nor the dejected haviour of the visage Together with all forms moods
shows of grief That can denote me truly These indeed seem For they
are actions that a man might play But I have that within which passeth
show These but the trappings and the suits of woe

KING Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet To give these
mourning duties to your father But you must know your father lost a
father That father lost lost his and the survivor bound In filial
obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow But to persevere In
obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness Tis unmanly
grief It shows a will most incorrect to heaven A heart unfortified a
mind impatient An understanding simple and unschoold For what we
know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense
Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart Fie tis a
fault to heaven A fault against the dead a fault to nature To reason
most absurd whose common theme Is death of fathers and who still hath
cried From the first corse till he that died today This must be so
We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe and think of us As of
a father for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our
throne And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest
father bears his son Do I impart toward you For your intent In going
back to school in Wittenberg It is most retrograde to our desire And
we beseech you bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our
eye Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son

QUEEN Let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet I pray thee stay
with us go not to Wittenberg

HAMLET I shall in all my best obey you madam

KING Why tis a loving and a fair reply Be as ourself in Denmark
Madam come This gentle and unforcd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to
my heart in grace whereof No jocund health that Denmark drinks today
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell And the Kings rouse the
heaven shall bruit again Respeaking earthly thunder Come away

 Exeunt all but Hamlet

HAMLET O that this too too solid flesh would melt Thaw and resolve
itself into a dew Or that the Everlasting had not fixd His canon
gainst selfslaughter O God O God How weary stale flat and
unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world Fie ont Oh fie
tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed things rank and gross in
nature Possess it merely That it should come to this But two months
deadnay not so much not two So excellent a king that was to this
Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother That he might not beteem
the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth Must
I remember Why she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had
grown By what it fed on and yet within a month Let me not think
ontFrailty thy name is woman A little month or ere those shoes
were old With which she followed my poor fathers body Like Niobe all
tearsWhy she even she O God A beast that wants discourse of reason
Would have mournd longermarried with mine uncle My fathers
brother but no more like my father Than I to Hercules Within a month
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her
galled eyes She married O most wicked speed to post With such
dexterity to incestuous sheets It is not nor it cannot come to good
But break my heart for I must hold my tongue

 Enter Horatio Marcellus and Barnardo

HORATIO Hail to your lordship

HAMLET I am glad to see you well Horatio or I do forget myself

HORATIO The same my lord And your poor servant ever

HAMLET Sir my good friend Ill change that name with you And what
make you from Wittenberg Horatio Marcellus

MARCELLUS My good lord

HAMLET I am very glad to see youGood even sir But what in faith
make you from Wittenberg

HORATIO A truant disposition good my lord

HAMLET I would not hear your enemy say so Nor shall you do my ear
that violence To make it truster of your own report Against yourself
I know you are no truant But what is your affair in Elsinore Well
teach you to drink deep ere you depart

HORATIO My lord I came to see your fathers funeral

HAMLET I prithee do not mock me fellowstudent I think it was to see
my mothers wedding

HORATIO Indeed my lord it followd hard upon

HAMLET Thrift thrift Horatio The funeral bakd meats Did coldly
furnish forth the marriage tables Would I had met my dearest foe in
heaven Or ever I had seen that day Horatio My fathermethinks I see
my father

HORATIO Where my lord

HAMLET In my minds eye Horatio

HORATIO I saw him once he was a goodly king

HAMLET He was a man take him for all in all I shall not look upon
his like again

HORATIO My lord I think I saw him yesternight

HAMLET Saw Who

HORATIO My lord the King your father

HAMLET The King my father

HORATIO Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear till I
may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you

HAMLET For Gods love let me hear

HORATIO Two nights together had these gentlemen Marcellus and
Barnardo on their watch In the dead waste and middle of the night
Been thus encounterd A figure like your father Armed at point
exactly cappie Appears before them and with solemn march Goes
slow and stately by them thrice he walkd By their oppressd and
fearsurprised eyes Within his truncheons length whilst they
distilld Almost to jelly with the act of fear Stand dumb and speak
not to him This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did And I with
them the third night kept the watch Where as they had deliverd both
in time Form of the thing each word made true and good The
apparition comes I knew your father These hands are not more like

HAMLET But where was this

MARCELLUS My lord upon the platform where we watch

HAMLET Did you not speak to it

HORATIO My lord I did But answer made it none yet once methought It
lifted up it head and did address Itself to motion like as it would
speak But even then the morning cock crew loud And at the sound it
shrunk in haste away And vanishd from our sight

HAMLET Tis very strange

HORATIO As I do live my honourd lord tis true And we did think it
writ down in our duty To let you know of it

HAMLET Indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me Hold you the watch
tonight

Mar and BARNARDO We do my lord

HAMLET Armd say you

Both Armd my lord

HAMLET From top to toe

BOTH My lord from head to foot

HAMLET Then saw you not his face

HORATIO O yes my lord he wore his beaver up

HAMLET What lookd he frowningly

HORATIO A countenance more in sorrow than in anger

HAMLET Pale or red

HORATIO Nay very pale

HAMLET And fixd his eyes upon you

HORATIO Most constantly

HAMLET I would I had been there

HORATIO It would have much amazd you

HAMLET Very like very like Stayd it long

HORATIO While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred

MARCELLUS and BARNARDO Longer longer

HORATIO Not when I sawt

HAMLET His beard was grizzled no

HORATIO It was as I have seen it in his life A sable silverd

HAMLET I will watch tonight Perchance twill walk again

HORATIO I warrant you it will

HAMLET If it assume my noble fathers person Ill speak to it though
hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace I pray you all If
you have hitherto conceald this sight Let it be tenable in your
silence still And whatsoever else shall hap tonight Give it an
understanding but no tongue I will requite your loves So fare ye
well Upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve Ill visit you

ALL Our duty to your honour

HAMLET Your loves as mine to you farewell

 Exeunt Horatio Marcellus and Barnardo

My fathers spirit in arms All is not well I doubt some foul play
would the night were come Till then sit still my soul foul deeds
will rise Though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes

 Exit

SCENE III A room in Poloniuss house

 Enter Laertes and Ophelia

LAERTES My necessaries are embarkd Farewell And sister as the
winds give benefit And convoy is assistant do not sleep But let me
hear from you

OPHELIA Do you doubt that

LAERTES For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour Hold it a fashion
and a toy in blood A violet in the youth of primy nature Forward not
permanent sweet not lasting The perfume and suppliance of a minute
No more

OPHELIA No more but so

LAERTES Think it no more For nature crescent does not grow alone In
thews and bulk but as this temple waxes The inward service of the
mind and soul Grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now And now no
soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will but you must
fear His greatness weighd his will is not his own For he himself is
subject to his birth He may not as unvalud persons do Carve for
himself for on his choice depends The sanctity and health of this
whole state And therefore must his choice be circumscribd Unto the
voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head Then if he says
he loves you It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his
particular act and place May give his saying deed which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal Then weigh what loss your
honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs Or lose
your heart or your chaste treasure open To his unmasterd importunity
Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister And keep you in the rear of
your affection Out of the shot and danger of desire The chariest maid
is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon Virtue itself
scopes not calumnious strokes The canker galls the infants of the
spring Too oft before their buttons be disclosd And in the morn and
liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent Be wary
then best safety lies in fear Youth to itself rebels though none
else near

OPHELIA I shall theffect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my
heart But good my brother Do not as some ungracious pastors do Show
me the steep and thorny way to heaven Whilst like a puffd and
reckless libertine Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And
recks not his own rede

LAERTES O fear me not I stay too long But here my father comes

 Enter Polonius

A double blessing is a double grace Occasion smiles upon a second
leave

POLONIUS Yet here Laertes Aboard aboard for shame The wind sits
in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayd for There my
blessing with you

 Laying his hand on Laertess head

And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character Give thy
thoughts no tongue Nor any unproportiond thought his act Be thou
familiar but by no means vulgar Those friends thou hast and their
adoption tried Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel But do
not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each newhatchd unfledgd
comrade Beware Of entrance to a quarrel but being in Beart that
thopposed may beware of thee Give every man thine ear but few thy
voice Take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment Costly thy
habit as thy purse can buy But not expressd in fancy rich not
gaudy For the apparel oft proclaims the man And they in France of the
best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that
Neither a borrower nor a lender be For loan oft loses both itself and
friend And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry This above all to
thine own self be true And it must follow as the night the day Thou
canst not then be false to any man Farewell my blessing season this
in thee

LAERTES Most humbly do I take my leave my lord

POLONIUS The time invites you go your servants tend

LAERTES Farewell Ophelia and remember well What I have said to you

OPHELIA Tis in my memory lockd And you yourself shall keep the key
of it

LAERTES Farewell

 Exit

POLONIUS What ist Ophelia he hath said to you

OPHELIA So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet

POLONIUS Marry well bethought Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you and you yourself Have of your audience been
most free and bounteous If it be soas so tis put on me And that in
way of cautionI must tell you You do not understand yourself so
clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour What is between you
Give me up the truth

OPHELIA He hath my lord of late made many tenders Of his affection
to me

POLONIUS Affection Pooh You speak like a green girl Unsifted in
such perilous circumstance Do you believe his tenders as you call
them

OPHELIA I do not know my lord what I should think

POLONIUS Marry Ill teach you think yourself a baby That you have
taen these tenders for true pay Which are not sterling Tender
yourself more dearly Ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase
Roaming it thusyoull tender me a fool

OPHELIA My lord he hath importund me with love In honourable
fashion

POLONIUS Ay fashion you may call it go to go to

OPHELIA And hath given countenance to his speech my lord With almost
all the holy vows of heaven

POLONIUS Ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know When the blood
burns how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows these blazes
daughter Giving more light than heat extinct in both Even in their
promise as it is amaking You must not take for fire From this time
Be something scanter of your maiden presence Set your entreatments at
a higher rate Than a command to parley For Lord Hamlet Believe so
much in him that he is young And with a larger tether may he walk Than
may be given you In few Ophelia Do not believe his vows for they
are brokers Not of that dye which their investments show But mere
implorators of unholy suits Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
The better to beguile This is for all I would not in plain terms
from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give
words or talk with the Lord Hamlet Look tot I charge you come your
ways

OPHELIA I shall obey my lord

 Exeunt

SCENE IV The platform

 Enter Hamlet Horatio and Marcellus

HAMLET The air bites shrewdly it is very cold

HORATIO It is a nipping and an eager air

HAMLET What hour now

HORATIO I think it lacks of twelve

MARCELLUS No it is struck

HORATIO Indeed I heard it not It then draws near the season Wherein
the spirit held his wont to walk

 A flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within

What does this mean my lord

HAMLET The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse Keeps wassail
and the swaggering upspring reels And as he drains his draughts of
Rhenish down The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of
his pledge

HORATIO Is it a custom

HAMLET Ay marry ist And to my mind though I am native here And to
the manner born it is a custom More honourd in the breach than the
observance This heavyheaded revel east and west Makes us traducd and
taxd of other nations They clepe us drunkards and with swinish
phrase Soil our addition and indeed it takes From our achievements
though performd at height The pith and marrow of our attribute So
oft it chances in particular men That for some vicious mole of nature
in them As in their birth wherein they are not guilty Since nature
cannot choose his origin By their oergrowth of some complexion Oft
breaking down the pales and forts of reason Or by some habit that too
much oerleavens The form of plausive mannersthat these men
Carrying I say the stamp of one defect Being Natures livery or
Fortunes star His virtues elsebe they as pure as grace As
infinite as man may undergo Shall in the general censure take
corruption From that particular fault The dram of evil Doth all the
noble substance often doubt To his own scandal

HORATIO Look my lord it comes

 Enter Ghost

HAMLET Angels and ministers of grace defend us Be thou a spirit of
health or goblin damnd Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts
from hell Be thy intents wicked or charitable Thou comst in such a
questionable shape That I will speak to thee Ill call thee Hamlet
King father royal Dane O answer me Let me not burst in ignorance
but tell Why thy canonizd bones hearsed in death Have burst their
cerements why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd Hath
opd his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again What may this
mean That thou dead corse again in complete steel Revisitst thus
the glimpses of the moon Making night hideous and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches
of our souls Say why is this Wherefore What should we do

 Ghost beckons Hamlet

HORATIO It beckons you to go away with it As if it some impartment
did desire To you alone

MARCELLUS Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more
removed ground But do not go with it

HORATIO No by no means

HAMLET It will not speak then will I follow it

HORATIO Do not my lord

HAMLET Why what should be the fear I do not set my life at a pins
fee And for my soul what can it do to that Being a thing immortal as
itself It waves me forth again Ill follow it

HORATIO What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord Or to the
dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles oer his base into the sea
And there assume some other horrible form Which might deprive your
sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness Think of it The very
place puts toys of desperation Without more motive into every brain
That looks so many fadoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath

HAMLET It waves me still Go on Ill follow thee

MARCELLUS You shall not go my lord

HAMLET Hold off your hands

HORATIO Be ruld you shall not go

HAMLET My fate cries out And makes each petty artery in this body As
hardy as the Nemean lions nerve

 Ghost beckons

Still am I calld Unhand me gentlemen

 Breaking free from them

By heaven Ill make a ghost of him that lets me I say awayGo on
Ill follow thee

 Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet

HORATIO He waxes desperate with imagination

MARCELLUS Lets follow tis not fit thus to obey him

HORATIO Have after To what issue will this come

MARCELLUS Something is rotten in the state of Denmark

HORATIO Heaven will direct it

MARCELLUS Nay lets follow him

 Exeunt

SCENE V A more remote part of the Castle

 Enter Ghost and Hamlet

HAMLET Whither wilt thou lead me Speak Ill go no further

GHOST Mark me

HAMLET I will

GHOST My hour is almost come When I to sulphrous and tormenting
flames Must render up myself

HAMLET Alas poor ghost

GHOST Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall
unfold

HAMLET Speak I am bound to hear

GHOST So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear

HAMLET What

GHOST I am thy fathers spirit Doomd for a certain term to walk the
night And for the day confind to fast in fires Till the foul crimes
done in my days of nature Are burnt and purgd away But that I am
forbid To tell the secrets of my prisonhouse I could a tale unfold
whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres Thy knotted and
combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end Like
quills upon the fretful porcupine But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood List list O list If thou didst ever thy
dear father love

HAMLET O God

GHOST Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder

HAMLET Murder

GHOST Murder most foul as in the best it is But this most foul
strange and unnatural

HAMLET Haste me to knowt that I with wings as swift As meditation
or the thoughts of love May sweep to my revenge

GHOST I find thee apt And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf Wouldst thou not stir in this
Now Hamlet hear Tis given out that sleeping in my orchard A
serpent stung me so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of
my death Rankly abusd but know thou noble youth The serpent that
did sting thy fathers life Now wears his crown

HAMLET O my prophetic soul Mine uncle

GHOST Ay that incestuous that adulterate beast With witchcraft of
his wit with traitorous gifts O wicked wit and gifts that have the
power So to seducewon to his shameful lust The will of my most
seemingvirtuous queen O Hamlet what a falling off was there From
me whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with
the vow I made to her in marriage and to decline Upon a wretch whose
natural gifts were poor To those of mine But virtue as it never will
be movd Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven So lust
though to a radiant angel linkd Will sate itself in a celestial bed
And prey on garbage But soft methinks I scent the morning air Brief
let me be Sleeping within my orchard My custom always of the
afternoon Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole With juice of cursed
hebenon in a vial And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous
distilment whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That
swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of
the body And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd like eager
droppings into milk The thin and wholesome blood So did it mine And
a most instant tetter barkd about Most lazarlike with vile and
loathsome crust All my smooth body Thus was I sleeping by a
brothers hand Of life of crown of queen at once dispatchd Cut off
even in the blossoms of my sin Unhousled disappointed unaneld No
reckoning made but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my
head O horrible O horrible most horrible If thou hast nature in
thee bear it not Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for
luxury and damned incest But howsoever thou pursust this act Taint
not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught leave
her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick
and sting her Fare thee well at once The glowworm shows the matin to
be near And gins to pale his uneffectual fire Adieu adieu adieu
Hamlet remember me

 Exit

HAMLET O all you host of heaven O earth What else And shall I
couple hell O fie Hold my heart And you my sinews grow not
instant old But bear me stiffly up Remember thee Ay thou poor
ghost while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe Remember
thee Yea from the table of my memory Ill wipe away all trivial fond
records All saws of books all forms all pressures past That youth
and observation copied there And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain Unmixd with baser matter Yes
by heaven O most pernicious woman O villain villain smiling damned
villain My tables Meet it is I set it down That one may smile and
smile and be a villain At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark

 Writing

So uncle there you are Now to my word It is Adieu adieu remember
me I have swornt

HORATIO and MARCELLUS Within My lord my lord

MARCELLUS Within Lord Hamlet

HORATIO Within Heaven secure him

HORATIO Good my lord tell it

HAMLET No youll reveal it

HORATIO Not I my lord by heaven

MARCELLUS Nor I my lord

HAMLET How say you then would heart of man once think it But youll
be secret

HORATIO and MARCELLUS Ay by heaven my lord

HAMLET Theres neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark But hes an
arrant knave

HORATIO There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave To tell us
this

HAMLET Why right you are i the right And so without more
circumstance at all I hold it fit that we shake hands and part You
as your business and desires shall point you For every man hath
business and desire Such as it isand for my own poor part Look you
Ill go pray

HORATIO These are but wild and whirling words my lord

HAMLET Im sorry they offend you heartily Yes faith heartily

HORATIO Theres no offence my lord

HAMLET Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio And much offence
too Touching this vision here It is an honest ghost that let me tell
you For your desire to know what is between us Oermastert as you
may And now good friends As you are friends scholars and soldiers
Give me one poor request

HORATIO What ist my lord We will

HAMLET Never make known what you have seen tonight

HORATIO and MARCELLUS My lord we will not

HAMLET Nay but sweart

HORATIO In faith my lord not I

MARCELLUS Nor I my lord in faith

HAMLET Upon my sword

HAMLET Indeed upon my sword indeed

GHOST Cries under the stage Swear

HAMLET Ha ha boy sayst thou so Art thou there truepenny Come on

HORATIO Propose the oath my lord

HAMLET Never to speak of this that you have seen Swear by my sword

HAMLET Hic et ubique Then well shift our ground Come hither

GHOST Beneath Swear

HAMLET Well said old mole Canst work i thearth so fast A worthy
pioner Once more remove good friends

HORATIO O day and night but this is wondrous strange

HAMLET And therefore as a stranger give it welcome There are more
things in heaven and earth Horatio Than are dreamt of in your
philosophy But come Here as before never so help you mercy How
strange or odd soeer I bear myself As I perchance hereafter shall
think meet To put an antic disposition on That you at such times
seeing me never shall With arms encumberd thus or this headshake
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase As Well we know or We
could and if we would Or If we list to speak or There be and if
they might Or such ambiguous giving out to note That you know aught
of methis not to do So grace and mercy at your most need help you
Swear

GHOST Beneath Swear

HAMLET Rest rest perturbed spirit So gentlemen With all my love I
do commend me to you And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do
texpress his love and friending to you God willing shall not lack
Let us go in together And still your fingers on your lips I pray The
time is out of joint O cursed spite That ever I was born to set it
right Nay come lets go together

ACT II

SCENE I A room in Poloniuss house

 Enter Polonius and Reynaldo

POLONIUS Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo

REYNALDO I will my lord

POLONIUS You shall do marvellous wisely good Reynaldo Before you
visit him to make inquiry Of his behaviour

REYNALDO My lord I did intend it

POLONIUS Marry well said very well said Look you sir Enquire me
first what Danskers are in Paris And how and who what means and
where they keep What company at what expense and finding By this
encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son come you
more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it Take you as
twere some distant knowledge of him As thus I know his father and
his friends And in part himdo you mark this Reynaldo

REYNALDO Ay very well my lord

POLONIUS And in part him but you may say not well But ift be
he I mean hes very wild Addicted so and so and there put on him
What forgeries you please marry none so rank As may dishonour him
take heed of that But sir such wanton wild and usual slips As are
companions noted and most known To youth and liberty

REYNALDO As gaming my lord

POLONIUS Ay or drinking fencing swearing Quarrelling drabbing
You may go so far

REYNALDO My lord that would dishonour him

POLONIUS Faith no as you may season it in the charge You must not
put another scandal on him That he is open to incontinency Thats not
my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the
taints of liberty The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind A savageness
in unreclaimed blood Of general assault

REYNALDO But my good lord

POLONIUS Wherefore should you do this

REYNALDO Ay my lord I would know that

POLONIUS Marry sir heres my drift And I believe it is a fetch of
warrant You laying these slight sullies on my son As twere a thing a
little soild i th working Mark you Your party in converse him you
would sound Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you
breathe of guilty be assurd He closes with you in this consequence
Good sir or so or friend or gentleman According to the phrase
or the addition Of man and country

REYNALDO Very good my lord

POLONIUS And then sir does he this He doesWhat was I about to
say By the mass I was about to say something Where did I leave

REYNALDO At closes in the consequence At friend or so and
gentleman

POLONIUS At closes in the consequence ay marry He closes with you
thus I know the gentleman I saw him yesterday or tother day Or
then or then with such and such and as you say There was he
gaming there oertook ins rouse There falling out at tennis or
perchance I saw him enter such a house of sale Videlicet a
brothel or so forth See you now Your bait of falsehood takes this
carp of truth And thus do we of wisdom and of reach With windlasses
and with assays of bias By indirections find directions out So by my
former lecture and advice Shall you my son You have me have you not

REYNALDO My lord I have

POLONIUS God b wi you fare you well

REYNALDO Good my lord

POLONIUS Observe his inclination in yourself

REYNALDO I shall my lord

POLONIUS And let him ply his music

REYNALDO Well my lord

POLONIUS Farewell

 Exit Reynaldo

 Enter Ophelia

How now Ophelia whats the matter

OPHELIA Alas my lord I have been so affrighted

POLONIUS With what in the name of God

OPHELIA My lord as I was sewing in my chamber Lord Hamlet with his
doublet all unbracd No hat upon his head his stockings fould
Ungartred and downgyved to his ankle Pale as his shirt his knees
knocking each other And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had
been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors he comes before me

POLONIUS Mad for thy love

OPHELIA My lord I do not know but truly I do fear it

POLONIUS What said he

OPHELIA He took me by the wrist and held me hard Then goes he to the
length of all his arm And with his other hand thus oer his brow He
falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it Long stayd he
so At lasta little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus
waving up and down He raisd a sigh so piteous and profound As it did
seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being That done he lets me
go And with his head over his shoulder turnd He seemd to find his
way without his eyes For out o doors he went without their help And
to the last bended their light on me

POLONIUS Come go with me I will go seek the King This is the very
ecstasy of love Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the
will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That
does afflict our natures I am sorry What have you given him any
hard words of late

OPHELIA No my good lord but as you did command I did repel his
letters and denied His access to me

POLONIUS That hath made him mad I am sorry that with better heed and
judgment I had not quoted him I feard he did but trifle And meant to
wreck thee But beshrew my jealousy It seems it is as proper to our
age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the
younger sort To lack discretion Come go we to the King This must be
known which being kept close might move More grief to hide than hate
to utter love

 Exeunt

SCENE II A room in the Castle

 Enter King Queen Rosencrantz Guildenstern and Attendants

KING Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Moreover that we much
did long to see you The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty
sending Something have you heard Of Hamlets transformation so I call
it Since nor thexterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was
What it should be More than his fathers death that thus hath put him
So much from thunderstanding of himself I cannot dream of I entreat
you both That being of so young days brought up with him And since so
neighbourd to his youth and humour That you vouchsafe your rest here
in our court Some little time so by your companies To draw him on to
pleasures and to gather So much as from occasion you may glean
Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That opend lies within
our remedy

QUEEN Good gentlemen he hath much talkd of you And sure I am two
men there are not living To whom he more adheres If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us
awhile For the supply and profit of our hope Your visitation shall
receive such thanks As fits a kings remembrance

ROSENCRANTZ Both your majesties Might by the sovereign power you have
of us Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty

GUILDENSTERN We both obey And here give up ourselves in the full
bent To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded

KING Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern

QUEEN Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz And I beseech you
instantly to visit My too much changed son Go some of you And bring
these gentlemen where Hamlet is

GUILDENSTERN Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and
helpful to him

QUEEN Ay amen

 Exeunt Rosencrantz Guildenstern and some Attendants

 Enter Polonius

POLONIUS Thambassadors from Norway my good lord Are joyfully
returnd

KING Thou still hast been the father of good news

POLONIUS Have I my lord Assure you my good liege I hold my duty
as I hold my soul Both to my God and to my gracious King And I do
thinkor else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath usd to dothat I have found The very cause of Hamlets
lunacy

KING O speak of that that do I long to hear

POLONIUS Give first admittance to thambassadors My news shall be the
fruit to that great feast

KING Thyself do grace to them and bring them in

 Exit Polonius

He tells me my sweet queen that he hath found The head and source of
all your sons distemper

QUEEN I doubt it is no other but the main His fathers death and our
oerhasty marriage

KING Well we shall sift him

 Enter Polonius with Voltemand and Cornelius

Welcome my good friends Say Voltemand what from our brother Norway

VOLTEMAND Most fair return of greetings and desires Upon our first
he sent out to suppress His nephews levies which to him appeard To
be a preparation gainst the Polack But better lookd into he truly
found It was against your Highness whereat grievd That so his
sickness age and impotence Was falsely borne in hand sends out
arrests On Fortinbras which he in brief obeys Receives rebuke from
Norway and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give
thassay of arms against your Majesty Whereon old Norway overcome
with joy Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his
commission to employ those soldiers So levied as before against the
Polack With an entreaty herein further shown Gives a paper That
it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this
enterprise On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set
down

KING It likes us well And at our more considerd time well read
Answer and think upon this business Meantime we thank you for your
welltook labour Go to your rest at night well feast together Most
welcome home

 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius

POLONIUS This business is well ended My liege and madam to
expostulate What majesty should be what duty is Why day is day night
night and time is time Were nothing but to waste night day and time
Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs
and outward flourishes I will be brief Your noble son is mad Mad
call I it for to define true madness What ist but to be nothing else
but mad But let that go

QUEEN More matter with less art

POLONIUS Madam I swear I use no art at all That he is mad tis
true tis true tis pity And pity tis tis true A foolish figure
But farewell it for I will use no art Mad let us grant him then And
now remains That we find out the cause of this effect Or rather say
the cause of this defect For this effect defective comes by cause
Thus it remains and the remainder thus Perpend I have a
daughterhave whilst she is mine Who in her duty and obedience mark
Hath given me this Now gather and surmise Reads To the
celestial and my souls idol the most beautified Ophelia Thats an
ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall
hear Reads these in her excellent white bosom these c

QUEEN Came this from Hamlet to her

POLONIUS Good madam stay awhile I will be faithful Reads
Doubt thou the stars are fire Doubt that the sun doth move Doubt
truth to be a liar But never doubt I love O dear Ophelia I am ill at
these numbers I have not art to reckon my groans But that I love thee
best O most best believe it Adieu Thine evermore most dear lady
whilst this machine is to him HAMLET This in obedience hath my
daughter showd me And more above hath his solicitings As they fell
out by time by means and place All given to mine ear

KING But how hath she receivd his love

POLONIUS What do you think of me

KING As of a man faithful and honourable

POLONIUS I would fain prove so But what might you think When I had
seen this hot love on the wing As I perceivd it I must tell you
that Before my daughter told me what might you Or my dear Majesty
your queen here think If I had playd the desk or tablebook Or
given my heart a winking mute and dumb Or lookd upon this love with
idle sight What might you think No I went round to work And my
young mistress thus I did bespeak Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy
star This must not be And then I precepts gave her That she should
lock herself from his resort Admit no messengers receive no tokens
Which done she took the fruits of my advice And he repulseda short
tale to make Fell into a sadness then into a fast Thence to a watch
thence into a weakness Thence to a lightness and by this declension
Into the madness wherein now he raves And all we wail for

KING Do you think tis this

QUEEN It may be very likely

POLONIUS Hath there been such a time Id fain know that That I have
positively said Tis so When it provd otherwise

KING Not that I know

POLONIUS Take this from this if this be otherwise Points to his
head and shoulder If circumstances lead me I will find Where truth
is hid though it were hid indeed Within the centre

KING How may we try it further

POLONIUS You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the
lobby

QUEEN So he does indeed

POLONIUS At such a time Ill loose my daughter to him Be you and I
behind an arras then Mark the encounter If he love her not And be
not from his reason falln thereon Let me be no assistant for a state
But keep a farm and carters

KING We will try it

 Enter Hamlet reading

QUEEN But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading

POLONIUS Away I do beseech you both away Ill board him presently
O give me leave

 Exeunt King Queen and Attendants

How does my good Lord Hamlet

HAMLET Well Godamercy

POLONIUS Do you know me my lord

HAMLET Excellent well Youre a fishmonger

POLONIUS Not I my lord

HAMLET Then I would you were so honest a man

POLONIUS Honest my lord

HAMLET Ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man
picked out of ten thousand

POLONIUS Thats very true my lord

HAMLET For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good
kissing carrion Have you a daughter

POLONIUS I have my lord

HAMLET Let her not walk i th sun Conception is a blessing but not
as your daughter may conceive Friend look tot

POLONIUS How say you by that Aside Still harping on my daughter
Yet he knew me not at first he said I was a fishmonger He is far
gone far gone And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
love very near this Ill speak to him againWhat do you read my
lord

HAMLET Words words words

POLONIUS What is the matter my lord

HAMLET Between who

POLONIUS I mean the matter that you read my lord

HAMLET Slanders sir For the satirical slave says here that old men
have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging
thick amber and plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit together with most weak hams All which sir though I most
powerfully and potently believe yet I hold it not honesty to have it
thus set down For you yourself sir should be old as I am if like a
crab you could go backward

POLONIUS Aside Though this be madness yet there is a method
int Will you walk out of the air my lord

HAMLET Into my grave

POLONIUS Indeed that is out o the air Aside How pregnant
sometimes his replies are A happiness that often madness hits on
which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of I
will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him
and my daughter My honourable lord I will most humbly take my leave
of you

HAMLET You cannot sir take from me anything that I will more
willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life

POLONIUS Fare you well my lord

HAMLET These tedious old fools

 Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

POLONIUS You go to seek the Lord Hamlet there he is

ROSENCRANTZ To Polonius God save you sir

 Exit Polonius

GUILDENSTERN My honoured lord

ROSENCRANTZ My most dear lord

HAMLET My excellent good friends How dost thou Guildenstern Ah
Rosencrantz Good lads how do ye both

ROSENCRANTZ As the indifferent children of the earth

GUILDENSTERN Happy in that we are not overhappy On Fortunes cap we
are not the very button

HAMLET Nor the soles of her shoe

ROSENCRANTZ Neither my lord

HAMLET Then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours

GUILDENSTERN Faith her privates we

HAMLET In the secret parts of Fortune O most true she is a
strumpet Whats the news

ROSENCRANTZ None my lord but that the worlds grown honest

HAMLET Then is doomsday near But your news is not true Let me
question more in particular What have you my good friends deserved
at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison hither

GUILDENSTERN Prison my lord

HAMLET Denmarks a prison

ROSENCRANTZ Then is the world one

HAMLET A goodly one in which there are many confines wards and
dungeons Denmark being one o th worst

ROSENCRANTZ We think not so my lord

HAMLET Why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or
bad but thinking makes it so To me it is a prison

ROSENCRANTZ Why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for
your mind

HAMLET O God I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
king of infinite space were it not that I have bad dreams

GUILDENSTERN Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream

HAMLET A dream itself is but a shadow

ROSENCRANTZ Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that it is but a shadows shadow

HAMLET Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretchd
heroes the beggars shadows Shall we to th court For by my fay I
cannot reason

ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN Well wait upon you

HAMLET No such matter I will not sort you with the rest of my
servants for to speak to you like an honest man I am most dreadfully
attended But in the beaten way of friendship what make you at
Elsinore

ROSENCRANTZ To visit you my lord no other occasion

HAMLET Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you
And sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny Were you
not sent for Is it your own inclining Is it a free visitation Come
deal justly with me Come come nay speak

GUILDENSTERN What should we say my lord

HAMLET Why anything But to the purpose You were sent for and there
is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not
craft enough to colour I know the good King and Queen have sent for
you

ROSENCRANTZ To what end my lord

HAMLET That you must teach me But let me conjure you by the rights
of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of
our everpreserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent
for or no

ROSENCRANTZ To Guildenstern What say you

HAMLET Aside Nay then I have an eye of you If you love me hold
not off

GUILDENSTERN My lord we were sent for

HAMLET I will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather I
have of late but wherefore I know not lost all my mirth forgone all
custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition
that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory
this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging
firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it
appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of
vapours What a piece of work is man How noble in reason How infinite
in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable In action
how like an angel In apprehension how like a god The beauty of the
world the paragon of animals And yet to me what is this
quintessence of dust Man delights not me no nor woman neither
though by your smiling you seem to say so

ROSENCRANTZ My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts

HAMLET Why did you laugh then when I said Man delights not me

ROSENCRANTZ To think my lord if you delight not in man what Lenten
entertainment the players shall receive from you We coted them on the
way and hither are they coming to offer you service

HAMLET He that plays the king shall be welcomehis Majesty shall have
tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target
the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in
peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th
sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall
halt fort What players are they

ROSENCRANTZ Even those you were wont to take such delight inthe
tragedians of the city

HAMLET How chances it they travel Their residence both in reputation
and profit was better both ways

ROSENCRANTZ I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
innovation

HAMLET Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
city Are they so followed

ROSENCRANTZ No indeed they are not

HAMLET How comes it Do they grow rusty

ROSENCRANTZ Nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there
is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of
question and are most tyrannically clapped fort These are now the
fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they call themthat many
wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come
thither

HAMLET What are they children Who maintains em How are they
escoted Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing
Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common
playersas it is most like if their means are no bettertheir writers
do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession

ROSENCRANTZ Faith there has been much to do on both sides and the
nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy There was for a
while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question

HAMLET Ist possible

GUILDENSTERN O there has been much throwing about of brains

HAMLET Do the boys carry it away

ROSENCRANTZ Ay that they do my lord Hercules and his load too

HAMLET It is not very strange for my uncle is King of Denmark and
those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty
forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little
Sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy
could find it out

 Flourish of trumpets within

GUILDENSTERN There are the players

HAMLET Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore Your hands come The
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony Let me comply with you
in this garb lest my extent to the players which I tell you must show
fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours You
are welcome But my unclefather and auntmother are deceived

GUILDENSTERN In what my dear lord

HAMLET I am but mad northnorthwest When the wind is southerly I
know a hawk from a handsaw

 Enter Polonius

POLONIUS Well be with you gentlemen

HAMLET Hark you Guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer That
great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts

ROSENCRANTZ Happily hes the second time come to them for they say an
old man is twice a child

HAMLET I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players Mark
itYou say right sir for a Monday morning twas so indeed

POLONIUS My lord I have news to tell you

HAMLET My lord I have news to tell you When Roscius was an actor in
Rome

POLONIUS The actors are come hither my lord

HAMLET Buzz buzz

POLONIUS Upon my honour

HAMLET Then came each actor on his ass

POLONIUS The best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy
history pastoral pastoralcomical historicalpastoral
tragicalhistorical tragicalcomicalhistoricalpastoral scene
individable or poem unlimited Seneca cannot be too heavy nor Plautus
too light for the law of writ and the liberty These are the only men

HAMLET O Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure hadst thou

POLONIUS What treasure had he my lord

HAMLET Why One fair daughter and no more The which he loved
passing well

POLONIUS Aside Still on my daughter

HAMLET Am I not i th right old Jephthah

POLONIUS If you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter that I
love passing well

HAMLET Nay that follows not

POLONIUS What follows then my lord

HAMLET Why As by lot God wot and then you know It came to pass
as most like it was The first row of the pious chanson will show you
more For look where my abridgement comes

 Enter four or five Players

You are welcome masters welcome all I am glad to see thee well
Welcome good friends O my old friend Thy face is valancd since I
saw thee last Comst thou to beard me in Denmark What my young lady
and mistress Byr lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I
saw you last by the altitude of a chopine Pray God your voice like a
piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring Masters you
are all welcome Well een tot like French falconers fly at anything
we see Well have a speech straight Come give us a taste of your
quality Come a passionate speech

FIRST PLAYER What speech my lord

HAMLET I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or
if it was not above once for the play I remember pleased not the
million twas caviare to the general But it wasas I received it and
others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of minean
excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much
modesty as cunning I remember one said there were no sallets in the
lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that
might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method
as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine One
speech in it I chiefly loved Twas Aeneas tale to Dido and
thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priams slaughter If it
live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see The
rugged Pyrrhus like th Hyrcanian beast It is not so it begins
with Pyrrhus The rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms Black as his
purpose did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominous
horse Hath now this dread and black complexion smeard With heraldry
more dismal Head to foot Now is he total gules horridly trickd With
blood of fathers mothers daughters sons Bakd and impasted with the
parching streets That lend a tyrannous and a damned light To their
vile murders Roasted in wrath and fire And thus oersized with
coagulate gore With eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus Old
grandsire Priam seeks So proceed you

POLONIUS Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and good
discretion

FIRST PLAYER Anon he finds him Striking too short at Greeks His
antique sword Rebellious to his arm lies where it falls Repugnant to
command Unequal matchd Pyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes
wide But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword Thunnerved father
falls Then senseless Ilium Seeming to feel this blow with flaming
top Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner
Pyrrhus ear For lo his sword Which was declining on the milky head
Of reverend Priam seemd i thair to stick So as a painted tyrant
Pyrrhus stood And like a neutral to his will and matter Did nothing
But as we often see against some storm A silence in the heavens the
rack stand still The bold winds speechless and the orb below As hush
as death anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region so after
Pyrrhus pause Aroused vengeance sets him new awork And never did
the Cyclops hammers fall On Marss armour forgd for proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus bleeding sword Now falls on Priam Out
out thou strumpet Fortune All you gods In general synod take away
her power Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel And bowl
the round nave down the hill of heaven As low as to the fiends

POLONIUS This is too long

HAMLET It shall to the barbers with your beardPrythee say on Hes
for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps Say on come to Hecuba

FIRST PLAYER But who O who had seen the mobled queen

HAMLET The mobled queen

POLONIUS Thats good Mobled queen is good

FIRST PLAYER Run barefoot up and down threatning the flames With
bisson rheum A clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood and
for a robe About her lank and all oerteemed loins A blanket in
thalarm of fear caught up Who this had seen with tongue in venom
steepd Gainst Fortunes state would treason have pronouncd But if
the gods themselves did see her then When she saw Pyrrhus make
malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husbands limbs The
instant burst of clamour that she made Unless things mortal move them
not at all Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven And
passion in the gods

POLONIUS Look where he has not turnd his colour and has tears ins
eyes Pray you no more

HAMLET Tis well Ill have thee speak out the rest of this soonGood
my lord will you see the players well bestowed Do you hear let them
be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the
time After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their
ill report while you live

POLONIUS My lord I will use them according to their desert

HAMLET Gods bodikin man better Use every man after his desert and
who should scape whipping Use them after your own honour and dignity
The less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty Take them in

POLONIUS Come sirs

HAMLET Follow him friends Well hear a play tomorrow

 Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First

Dost thou hear me old friend Can you play The Murder of Gonzago

FIRST PLAYER Ay my lord

HAMLET Well hat tomorrow night You could for a need study a speech
of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert int
could you not

FIRST PLAYER Ay my lord

HAMLET Very well Follow that lord and look you mock him not

 Exit First Player

To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern My good friends Ill leave you
till night You are welcome to Elsinore

ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord

 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

HAMLET Ay so God b wi ye Now I am alone O what a rogue and
peasant slave am I Is it not monstrous that this player here But in a
fiction in a dream of passion Could force his soul so to his own
conceit That from her working all his visage wand Tears in his eyes
distraction ins aspect A broken voice and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit And all for nothing For Hecuba Whats
Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba That he should weep for her What would
he do Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have He would
drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid
speech Make mad the guilty and appal the free Confound the ignorant
and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears Yet I A dull
and muddymettled rascal peak Like Johnadreams unpregnant of my
cause And can say nothing No not for a king Upon whose property and
most dear life A damnd defeat was made Am I a coward Who calls me
villain breaks my pate across Plucks off my beard and blows it in my
face Tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i th throat As deep as
to the lungs Who does me this Ha Swounds I should take it for it
cannot be But I am pigeonliverd and lack gall To make oppression
bitter or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this
slaves offal Bloody bawdy villain Remorseless treacherous
lecherous kindless villain Oh vengeance Why what an ass am I This
is most brave That I the son of a dear father murderd Prompted to
my revenge by heaven and hell Must like a whore unpack my heart with
words And fall acursing like a very drab A scullion Fie upont Foh
About my brain I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that
presently They have proclaimd their malefactions For murder though
it have no tongue will speak With most miraculous organ Ill have
these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine
uncle Ill observe his looks Ill tent him to the quick If he but
blench I know my course The spirit that I have seen May be the devil
and the devil hath power Tassume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy As he is very potent with such
spirits Abuses me to damn me Ill have grounds More relative than
this The plays the thing Wherein Ill catch the conscience of the
King

ACT III

SCENE I A room in the Castle

 Enter King Queen Polonius Ophelia Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

KING And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts
on this confusion Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With
turbulent and dangerous lunacy

ROSENCRANTZ He does confess he feels himself distracted But from what
cause he will by no means speak

GUILDENSTERN Nor do we find him forward to be sounded But with a
crafty madness keeps aloof When we would bring him on to some
confession Of his true state

QUEEN Did he receive you well

ROSENCRANTZ Most like a gentleman

GUILDENSTERN But with much forcing of his disposition

ROSENCRANTZ Niggard of question but of our demands Most free in his
reply

QUEEN Did you assay him to any pastime

ROSENCRANTZ Madam it so fell out that certain players We oerraught
on the way Of these we told him And there did seem in him a kind of
joy To hear of it They are about the court And as I think they have
already order This night to play before him

POLONIUS Tis most true And he beseechd me to entreat your Majesties
To hear and see the matter

KING With all my heart and it doth much content me To hear him so
inclind Good gentlemen give him a further edge And drive his
purpose on to these delights

ROSENCRANTZ We shall my lord

 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

KING Sweet Gertrude leave us too For we have closely sent for Hamlet
hither That he as twere by accident may here Affront Ophelia Her
father and myself lawful espials Will so bestow ourselves that
seeing unseen We may of their encounter frankly judge And gather by
him as he is behavd Ift be thaffliction of his love or no That
thus he suffers for

QUEEN I shall obey you And for your part Ophelia I do wish That
your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlets wildness so shall I
hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again To both your
honours

OPHELIA Madam I wish it may

 Exit Queen

POLONIUS Ophelia walk you hereGracious so please you We will
bestow ourselvesTo Ophelia Read on this book That show of such
an exercise may colour Your lonelinessWe are oft to blame in this
Tis too much provd that with devotions visage And pious action we
do sugar oer The devil himself

KING Aside O tis too true How smart a lash that speech doth
give my conscience The harlots cheek beautied with plastering art
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most
painted word O heavy burden

POLONIUS I hear him coming Lets withdraw my lord

 Exeunt King and Polonius

 Enter Hamlet

HAMLET To be or not to be that is the question Whether tis nobler
in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or
to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them To
dieto sleep No more and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and
the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wishd To die to sleep To sleep perchance to
dreamay theres the rub For in that sleep of death what dreams may
come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil Must give us pause
Theres the respect That makes calamity of so long life For who would
bear the whips and scorns of time The oppressors wrong the proud
mans contumely The pangs of disprizd love the laws delay The
insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy
takes When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin Who
would these fardels bear To grunt and sweat under a weary life But
that the dread of something after death The undiscoverd country from
whose bourn No traveller returns puzzles the will And makes us rather
bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of Thus
conscience does make cowards of us all And thus the native hue of
resolution Is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought And
enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents
turn awry And lose the name of action Soft you now The fair Ophelia
Nymph in thy orisons Be all my sins rememberd

OPHELIA Good my lord How does your honour for this many a day

HAMLET I humbly thank you well well well

OPHELIA My lord I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long
to redeliver I pray you now receive them

HAMLET No not I I never gave you aught

OPHELIA My honourd lord you know right well you did And with them
words of so sweet breath composd As made the things more rich their
perfume lost Take these again for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax
poor when givers prove unkind There my lord

HAMLET Ha ha Are you honest

OPHELIA My lord

HAMLET Are you fair

OPHELIA What means your lordship

HAMLET That if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty

OPHELIA Could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty

HAMLET Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
translate beauty into his likeness This was sometime a paradox but
now the time gives it proof I did love you once

OPHELIA Indeed my lord you made me believe so

HAMLET You should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate
our old stock but we shall relish of it I loved you not

OPHELIA I was the more deceived

HAMLET Get thee to a nunnery Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners I am myself indifferent honest but yet I could accuse me of
such things that it were better my mother had not borne me I am very
proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than I have
thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act
them in What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and
heaven We are arrant knaves all believe none of us Go thy ways to a
nunnery Wheres your father

OPHELIA At home my lord

HAMLET Let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool
nowhere but ins own house Farewell

OPHELIA O help him you sweet heavens

HAMLET If thou dost marry Ill give thee this plague for thy dowry
Be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape
calumny Get thee to a nunnery go farewell Or if thou wilt needs
marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you
make of them To a nunnery go and quickly too Farewell

OPHELIA O heavenly powers restore him

HAMLET I have heard of your paintings too well enough God hath given
you one face and you make yourselves another You jig you amble and
you lisp and nickname Gods creatures and make your wantonness your
ignorance Go to Ill no more ont it hath made me mad I say we
will have no more marriages Those that are married already all but
one shall live the rest shall keep as they are To a nunnery go

 Exit

OPHELIA O what a noble mind is here oerthrown The courtiers
soldiers scholars eye tongue sword Thexpectancy and rose of the
fair state The glass of fashion and the mould of form Thobservd of
all observers quite quite down And I of ladies most deject and
wretched That suckd the honey of his music vows Now see that noble
and most sovereign reason Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and
harsh That unmatchd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with
ecstasy O woe is me Thave seen what I have seen see what I see

 Enter King and Polonius

KING Love His affections do not that way tend Nor what he spake
though it lackd form a little Was not like madness Theres something
in his soul Oer which his melancholy sits on brood And I do doubt the
hatch and the disclose Will be some danger which for to prevent I
have in quick determination Thus set it down he shall with speed to
England For the demand of our neglected tribute Haply the seas and
countries different With variable objects shall expel This something
settled matter in his heart Whereon his brains still beating puts him
thus From fashion of himself What think you ont

POLONIUS It shall do well But yet do I believe The origin and
commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love How now Ophelia
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said We heard it all My lord
do as you please But if you hold it fit after the play Let his queen
mother all alone entreat him To show his grief let her be round with
him And Ill be placd so please you in the ear Of all their
conference If she find him not To England send him or confine him
where Your wisdom best shall think

KING It shall be so Madness in great ones must not unwatchd go

 Exeunt

SCENE II A hall in the Castle

 Enter Hamlet and certain Players

HAMLET Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounced it to you
trippingly on the tongue But if you mouth it as many of your players
do I had as lief the towncrier spoke my lines Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very
torrent tempest and as I may say whirlwind of passion you must
acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness O it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a
passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings
who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
shows and noise I would have such a fellow whipped for oerdoing
Termagant It outHerods Herod Pray you avoid it

FIRST PLAYER I warrant your honour

HAMLET Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your
tutor Suit the action to the word the word to the action with this
special observance that you oerstep not the modesty of nature for
anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at
the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to
nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the
very age and body of the time his form and pressure Now this
overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot
but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in
your allowance oerweigh a whole theatre of others O there be players
that I have seen playand heard others praise and that highlynot to
speak it profanely that neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed
that I have thought some of Natures journeymen had made men and not
made them well they imitated humanity so abominably

FIRST PLAYER I hope we have reformd that indifferently with us sir

HAMLET O reform it altogether And let those that play your clowns
speak no more than is set down for them For there be of them that will
themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then
to be considered Thats villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it Go make you ready

 Exeunt Players

 Enter Polonius Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

How now my lord Will the King hear this piece of work

POLONIUS And the Queen too and that presently

HAMLET Bid the players make haste

 Exit Polonius

Will you two help to hasten them

ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN We will my lord

 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

HAMLET What ho Horatio

 Enter Horatio

HORATIO Here sweet lord at your service

HAMLET Horatio thou art een as just a man As eer my conversation
copd withal

HORATIO O my dear lord

HAMLET Nay do not think I flatter For what advancement may I hope
from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits To feed and
clothe thee Why should the poor be flatterd No let the candied
tongue lick absurd pomp And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear Since my dear soul was
mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish her election Hath
seald thee for herself For thou hast been As one in suffering all
that suffers nothing A man that Fortunes buffets and rewards Hast
taen with equal thanks And blesd are those Whose blood and judgment
are so well comingled That they are not a pipe for Fortunes finger To
sound what stop she please Give me that man That is not passions
slave and I will wear him In my hearts core ay in my heart of
heart As I do thee Something too much of this There is a play
tonight before the King One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my fathers death I prythee when thou
seest that act afoot Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe
mine uncle If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech
It is a damned ghost that we have seen And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcans stithy Give him heedful note For I mine eyes will rivet
to his face And after we will both our judgments join In censure of
his seeming

HORATIO Well my lord If he steal aught the whilst this play is
playing And scape detecting I will pay the theft

HAMLET They are coming to the play I must be idle Get you a place

KING I have nothing with this answer Hamlet these words are not
mine

HAMLET No nor mine now To Polonius My lord you playd once i
thuniversity you say

POLONIUS That did I my lord and was accounted a good actor

HAMLET What did you enact

POLONIUS I did enact Julius Caesar I was killd i th Capitol
Brutus killed me

HAMLET It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there Be
the players ready

ROSENCRANTZ Ay my lord they stay upon your patience

QUEEN Come hither my dear Hamlet sit by me

HAMLET No good mother heres metal more attractive

POLONIUS To the King O ho do you mark that

HAMLET Lady shall I lie in your lap

 Lying down at Ophelias feet

OPHELIA No my lord

HAMLET I mean my head upon your lap

OPHELIA Ay my lord

HAMLET Do you think I meant country matters

OPHELIA I think nothing my lord

HAMLET Thats a fair thought to lie between maids legs

OPHELIA What is my lord

HAMLET Nothing

OPHELIA You are merry my lord

HAMLET Who I

OPHELIA Ay my lord

HAMLET O God your only jigmaker What should a man do but be merry
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died
withins two hours

OPHELIA Nay tis twice two months my lord

HAMLET So long Nay then let the devil wear black for Ill have a
suit of sables O heavens die two months ago and not forgotten yet
Then theres hope a great mans memory may outlive his life half a
year But byr lady he must build churches then or else shall he
suffer not thinking on with the hobbyhorse whose epitaph is For O
for O the hobbyhorse is forgot

 Trumpets sound The dumb show enters

Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly the Queen embracing him and he
her She kneels and makes show of protestation unto him He takes her
up and declines his head upon her neck Lays him down upon a bank of
flowers She seeing him asleep leaves him Anon comes in a fellow
takes off his crown kisses it pours poison in the Kings ears and
exits The Queen returns finds the King dead and makes passionate
action The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes comes in again
seeming to lament with her The dead body is carried away The Poisoner
woos the Queen with gifts She seems loth and unwilling awhile but in
the end accepts his love

 Exeunt

OPHELIA What means this my lord

HAMLET Marry this is miching mallicho it means mischief

OPHELIA Belike this show imports the argument of the play

 Enter Prologue

HAMLET We shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel
theyll tell all

OPHELIA Will they tell us what this show meant

HAMLET Ay or any show that youll show him Be not you ashamed to
show hell not shame to tell you what it means

OPHELIA You are naught you are naught Ill mark the play

PROLOGUE For us and for our tragedy Here stooping to your clemency
We beg your hearing patiently

HAMLET Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring

OPHELIA Tis brief my lord

HAMLET As womans love

 Enter a King and a Queen

PLAYER KING Full thirty times hath Phoebus cart gone round Neptunes
salt wash and Tellus orbed ground And thirty dozen moons with
borrowd sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been Since
love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacred
bands

PLAYER QUEEN So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count
oer ere love be done But woe is me you are so sick of late So far
from cheer and from your former state That I distrust you Yet though
I distrust Discomfort you my lord it nothing must For womens fear
and love holds quantity In neither aught or in extremity Now what my
love is proof hath made you know And as my love is sizd my fear is
so Where love is great the littlest doubts are fear Where little
fears grow great great love grows there

PLAYER KING Faith I must leave thee love and shortly too My
operant powers their functions leave to do And thou shalt live in this
fair world behind Honourd belovd and haply one as kind For husband
shalt thou

PLAYER QUEEN O confound the rest Such love must needs be treason in
my breast In second husband let me be accurst None wed the second but
who killd the first

HAMLET Aside Wormwood wormwood

PLAYER QUEEN The instances that second marriage move Are base respects
of thrift but none of love A second time I kill my husband dead When
second husband kisses me in bed

PLAYER KING I do believe you think what now you speak But what we do
determine oft we break Purpose is but the slave to memory Of violent
birth but poor validity Which now like fruit unripe sticks on the
tree But fall unshaken when they mellow be Most necessary tis that
we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt What to ourselves
in passion we propose The passion ending doth the purpose lose The
violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves
destroy Where joy most revels grief doth most lament Grief joys joy
grieves on slender accident This world is not for aye nor tis not
strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change For tis a
question left us yet to prove Whether love lead fortune or else
fortune love The great man down you mark his favourite flies The
poor advancd makes friends of enemies And hitherto doth love on
fortune tend For who not needs shall never lack a friend And who in
want a hollow friend doth try Directly seasons him his enemy But
orderly to end where I begun Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown Our thoughts are ours their
ends none of our own So think thou wilt no second husband wed But die
thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead

PLAYER QUEEN Nor earth to me give food nor heaven light Sport and
repose lock from me day and night To desperation turn my trust and
hope An anchors cheer in prison be my scope Each opposite that
blanks the face of joy Meet what I would have well and it destroy
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife If once a widow ever I
be wife

HAMLET To Ophelia If she should break it now

PLAYER KING Tis deeply sworn Sweet leave me here awhile My spirits
grow dull and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep
Sleeps

PLAYER QUEEN Sleep rock thy brain And never come mischance between us
twain

 Exit

HAMLET Madam how like you this play

QUEEN The lady protests too much methinks

HAMLET O but shell keep her word

KING Have you heard the argument Is there no offence int

HAMLET No no they do but jest poison in jest no offence i th
world

KING What do you call the play

HAMLET The Mousetrap Marry how Tropically This play is the image
of a murder done in Vienna Gonzago is the Dukes name his wife
Baptista you shall see anon tis a knavish piece of work but what o
that Your majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not Let
the galld jade wince our withers are unwrung

 Enter Lucianus

This is one Lucianus nephew to the King

OPHELIA You are a good chorus my lord

HAMLET I could interpret between you and your love if I could see the
puppets dallying

OPHELIA You are keen my lord you are keen

HAMLET It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge

OPHELIA Still better and worse

HAMLET So you mistake your husbandsBegin murderer Pox leave thy
damnable faces and begin Come the croaking raven doth bellow for
revenge

LUCIANUS Thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing
Confederate season else no creature seeing Thou mixture rank of
midnight weeds collected With Hecates ban thrice blasted thrice
infected Thy natural magic and dire property On wholesome life usurp
immediately

 Pours the poison into the sleepers ears

HAMLET He poisons him i thgarden fors estate His names Gonzago
The story is extant and written in very choice Italian You shall see
anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzagos wife

OPHELIA The King rises

HAMLET What frighted with false fire

QUEEN How fares my lord

POLONIUS Give oer the play

KING Give me some light Away

All Lights lights lights

 Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio

HAMLET Why let the strucken deer go weep The hart ungalled play For
some must watch while some must sleep So runs the world away Would
not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes
turn Turk with me with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes get me
a fellowship in a cry of players sir

HORATIO Half a share

HAMLET A whole one I For thou dost know O Damon dear This realm
dismantled was Of Jove himself and now reigns here A very
verypajock

HORATIO You might have rhymed

HAMLET O good Horatio Ill take the ghosts word for a thousand
pound Didst perceive

HORATIO Very well my lord

HAMLET Upon the talk of the poisoning

HORATIO I did very well note him

HAMLET Ah ha Come some music Come the recorders For if the king
like not the comedy Why then belike he likes it not perdie Come
some music

 Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

GUILDENSTERN Good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you

HAMLET Sir a whole history

GUILDENSTERN The King sir

HAMLET Ay sir what of him

GUILDENSTERN Is in his retirement marvellous distempered

HAMLET With drink sir

GUILDENSTERN No my lord rather with choler

HAMLET Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
the doctor for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him
into far more choler

GUILDENSTERN Good my lord put your discourse into some frame and
start not so wildly from my affair

HAMLET I am tame sir pronounce

GUILDENSTERN The Queen your mother in most great affliction of
spirit hath sent me to you

HAMLET You are welcome

GUILDENSTERN Nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right
breed If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer I will do
your mothers commandment if not your pardon and my return shall be
the end of my business

HAMLET Sir I cannot

GUILDENSTERN What my lord

HAMLET Make you a wholesome answer My wits diseased But sir such
answer as I can make you shall command or rather as you say my
mother Therefore no more but to the matter My mother you say

ROSENCRANTZ Then thus she says your behaviour hath struck her into
amazement and admiration

HAMLET O wonderful son that can so stonish a mother But is there no
sequel at the heels of this mothers admiration

ROSENCRANTZ She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed

HAMLET We shall obey were she ten times our mother Have you any
further trade with us

ROSENCRANTZ My lord you once did love me

HAMLET And so I do still by these pickers and stealers

ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord what is your cause of distemper You do
surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to
your friend

HAMLET Sir I lack advancement

ROSENCRANTZ How can that be when you have the voice of the King
himself for your succession in Denmark

HAMLET Ay sir but while the grass growsthe proverb is something
musty

 Reenter the Players with recorders

O the recorders Let me see oneTo withdraw with you why do you go
about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil

GUILDENSTERN O my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too
unmannerly

HAMLET I do not well understand that Will you play upon this pipe

GUILDENSTERN My lord I cannot

HAMLET I pray you

GUILDENSTERN Believe me I cannot

HAMLET I do beseech you

GUILDENSTERN I know no touch of it my lord

HAMLET Tis as easy as lying govern these ventages with your finger
and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most
eloquent music Look you these are the stops

GUILDENSTERN But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony I
have not the skill

HAMLET Why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me You
would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck
out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in
this little organ yet cannot you make it speak Sblood do you think
I am easier to be played on than a pipe Call me what instrument you
will though you can fret me you cannot play upon me

 Enter Polonius

God bless you sir

POLONIUS My lord the Queen would speak with you and presently

HAMLET Do you see yonder cloud thats almost in shape of a camel

POLONIUS By the mass and tis like a camel indeed

HAMLET Methinks it is like a weasel

POLONIUS It is backed like a weasel

HAMLET Or like a whale

POLONIUS Very like a whale

HAMLET Then will I come to my mother by and byThey fool me to the
top of my bentI will come by and by

POLONIUS I will say so

 Exit

HAMLET By and by is easily said Leave me friends

 Exeunt all but Hamlet

Tis now the very witching time of night When churchyards yawn and
hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world Now could I drink hot
blood And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on
Soft now to my mother O heart lose not thy nature let not ever The
soul of Nero enter this firm bosom Let me be cruel not unnatural I
will speak daggers to her but use none My tongue and soul in this be
hypocrites How in my words somever she be shent To give them seals
never my soul consent

KING I like him not nor stands it safe with us To let his madness
range Therefore prepare you I your commission will forthwith
dispatch And he to England shall along with you The terms of our
estate may not endure Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow Out of his
lunacies

GUILDENSTERN We will ourselves provide Most holy and religious fear
it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your
Majesty

ROSENCRANTZ The single and peculiar life is bound With all the
strength and armour of the mind To keep itself from noyance but much
more That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest The lives of many The
cease of majesty Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw Whats near
it with it It is a massy wheel Fixd on the summit of the highest
mount To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortisd and
adjoind which when it falls Each small annexment petty consequence
Attends the boistrous ruin Never alone Did the King sigh but with a
general groan

KING Arm you I pray you to this speedy voyage For we will fetters
put upon this fear Which now goes too freefooted

ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN We will haste us

 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

 Enter Polonius

POLONIUS My lord hes going to his mothers closet Behind the arras
Ill convey myself To hear the process Ill warrant shell tax him
home And as you said and wisely was it said Tis meet that some more
audience than a mother Since nature makes them partial should
oerhear The speech of vantage Fare you well my liege Ill call upon
you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know

KING Thanks dear my lord

 Exit Polonius

O my offence is rank it smells to heaven It hath the primal eldest
curse upont A brothers murder Pray can I not Though inclination
be as sharp as will My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent And
like a man to double business bound I stand in pause where I shall
first begin And both neglect What if this cursed hand Were thicker
than itself with brothers blood Is there not rain enough in the sweet
heavens To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy But to confront
the visage of offence And whats in prayer but this twofold force To
be forestalled ere we come to fall Or pardond being down Then Ill
look up My fault is past But O what form of prayer Can serve my
turn Forgive me my foul murder That cannot be since I am still
possessd Of those effects for which I did the murder My crown mine
own ambition and my queen May one be pardond and retain thoffence
In the corrupted currents of this world Offences gilded hand may shove
by justice And oft tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law
But tis not so above There is no shuffling there the action lies In
his true nature and we ourselves compelld Even to the teeth and
forehead of our faults To give in evidence What then What rests Try
what repentance can What can it not Yet what can it when one cannot
repent O wretched state O bosom black as death O limed soul that
struggling to be free Art more engagd Help angels Make assay Bow
stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel Be soft as sinews of
the newborn babe All may be well

 Retires and kneels

 Enter Hamlet

HAMLET Now might I do it pat now he is praying And now Ill dot
And so he goes to heaven And so am I revengd That would be scannd
A villain kills my father and for that I his sole son do this same
villain send To heaven O this is hire and salary not revenge He
took my father grossly full of bread With all his crimes broad blown
as flush as May And how his audit stands who knows save heaven But
in our circumstance and course of thought Tis heavy with him And am
I then revengd To take him in the purging of his soul When he is fit
and seasond for his passage No Up sword and know thou a more
horrid hent When he is drunk asleep or in his rage Or in
thincestuous pleasure of his bed At gaming swearing or about some
act That has no relish of salvation int Then trip him that his heels
may kick at heaven And that his soul may be as damnd and black As
hell whereto it goes My mother stays This physic but prolongs thy
sickly days

 Exit

 The King rises and advances

KING My words fly up my thoughts remain below Words without thoughts
never to heaven go

QUEEN Have you forgot me

HAMLET No by the rood not so You are the Queen your husbands
brothers wife And would it were not so You are my mother

QUEEN Nay then Ill set those to you that can speak

HAMLET Come come and sit you down you shall not budge You go not
till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you

QUEEN What wilt thou do Thou wilt not murder me Help help ho

POLONIUS Behind What ho help help help

HAMLET How now A rat Draws Dead for a ducat dead

 Makes a pass through the arras

POLONIUS Behind O I am slain

 Falls and dies

QUEEN O me what hast thou done

HAMLET Nay I know not is it the King

 Draws forth Polonius

QUEEN O what a rash and bloody deed is this

HAMLET A bloody deed Almost as bad good mother As kill a king and
marry with his brother

QUEEN As kill a king

HAMLET Ay lady twas my word To Polonius Thou wretched rash
intruding fool farewell I took thee for thy better Take thy fortune
Thou findst to be too busy is some danger Leave wringing of your
hands Peace sit you down And let me wring your heart for so I
shall If it be made of penetrable stuff If damned custom have not
brazd it so That it is proof and bulwark against sense

QUEEN What have I done that thou darst wag thy tongue In noise so
rude against me

HAMLET Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty Calls
virtue hypocrite takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an
innocent love And sets a blister there Makes marriage vows As false
as dicers oaths O such a deed As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words Heavens
face doth glow Yea this solidity and compound mass With tristful
visage as against the doom Is thoughtsick at the act

QUEEN Ay me what act That roars so loud and thunders in the index

HAMLET Look here upon this picture and on this The counterfeit
presentment of two brothers See what a grace was seated on this brow
Hyperions curls the front of Jove himself An eye like Mars to
threaten and command A station like the herald Mercury New lighted on
a heavenkissing hill A combination and a form indeed Where every god
did seem to set his seal To give the world assurance of a man This
was your husband Look you now what follows Here is your husband like
a mildewd ear Blasting his wholesome brother Have you eyes Could you
on this fair mountain leave to feed And batten on this moor Ha have
you eyes You cannot call it love for at your age The heyday in the
blood is tame its humble And waits upon the judgment and what
judgment Would step from this to this Sense sure you have Else could
you not have motion but sure that sense Is apoplexd for madness
would not err Nor sense to ecstacy was neer so thralld But it
reservd some quantity of choice To serve in such a difference What
devil wast That thus hath cozend you at hoodmanblind Eyes without
feeling feeling without sight Ears without hands or eyes smelling
sans all Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope O
shame where is thy blush Rebellious hell If thou canst mutine in a
matrons bones To flaming youth let virtue be as wax And melt in her
own fire Proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the
charge Since frost itself as actively doth burn And reason panders
will

QUEEN O Hamlet speak no more Thou turnst mine eyes into my very
soul And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave
their tinct

HAMLET Nay but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed Stewd
in corruption honeying and making love Over the nasty sty

QUEEN O speak to me no more These words like daggers enter in mine
ears No more sweet Hamlet

HAMLET A murderer and a villain A slave that is not twentieth part
the tithe Of your precedent lord A vice of kings A cutpurse of the
empire and the rule That from a shelf the precious diadem stole And
put it in his pocket

QUEEN No more

HAMLET A king of shreds and patches

 Enter Ghost

Save me and hover oer me with your wings You heavenly guards What
would your gracious figure

QUEEN Alas hes mad

HAMLET Do you not come your tardy son to chide That lapsd in time
and passion lets go by The important acting of your dread command O
say

GHOST Do not forget This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted
purpose But look amazement on thy mother sits O step between her and
her fighting soul Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works Speak to
her Hamlet

HAMLET How is it with you lady

QUEEN Alas how ist with you That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse Forth at your eyes your
spirits wildly peep And as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm Your
bedded hairs like life in excrements Start up and stand an end O
gentle son Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool
patience Whereon do you look

HAMLET On him on him Look you how pale he glares His form and cause
conjoind preaching to stones Would make them capableDo not look
upon me Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects
Then what I have to do Will want true colour tears perchance for
blood

QUEEN To whom do you speak this

HAMLET Do you see nothing there

QUEEN Nothing at all yet all that is I see

HAMLET Nor did you nothing hear

QUEEN No nothing but ourselves

HAMLET Why look you there look how it steals away My father in his
habit as he livd Look where he goes even now out at the portal

 Exit Ghost

QUEEN This is the very coinage of your brain This bodiless creation
ecstasy Is very cunning in

HAMLET Ecstasy My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time And
makes as healthful music It is not madness That I have utterd Bring
me to the test And I the matter will reword which madness Would
gambol from Mother for love of grace Lay not that flattering unction
to your soul That not your trespass but my madness speaks It will but
skin and film the ulcerous place Whilst rank corruption mining all
within Infects unseen Confess yourself to heaven Repent whats past
avoid what is to come And do not spread the compost on the weeds To
make them ranker Forgive me this my virtue For in the fatness of
these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg Yea curb and
woo for leave to do him good

QUEEN O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain

HAMLET O throw away the worser part of it And live the purer with the
other half Good night But go not to mine uncles bed Assume a
virtue if you have it not That monster custom who all sense doth
eat Of habits evil is angel yet in this That to the use of actions
fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery That aptly is put on
Refrain tonight And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next
abstinence The next more easy For use almost can change the stamp of
nature And either curb the devil or throw him out With wondrous
potency Once more good night And when you are desirous to be blesd
Ill blessing beg of you For this same lord Pointing to Polonius
I do repent but heaven hath pleasd it so To punish me with this and
this with me That I must be their scourge and minister I will bestow
him and will answer well The death I gave him So again good night I
must be cruel only to be kind Thus bad begins and worse remains
behind One word more good lady

QUEEN What shall I do

HAMLET Not this by no means that I bid you do Let the bloat King
tempt you again to bed Pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
And let him for a pair of reechy kisses Or paddling in your neck with
his damnd fingers Make you to ravel all this matter out That I
essentially am not in madness But mad in craft Twere good you let
him know For who thats but a queen fair sober wise Would from a
paddock from a bat a gib Such dear concernings hide Who would do
so No in despite of sense and secrecy Unpeg the basket on the
houses top Let the birds fly and like the famous ape To try
conclusions in the basket creep And break your own neck down

QUEEN Be thou assurd if words be made of breath And breath of life
I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me

HAMLET I must to England you know that

QUEEN Alack I had forgot Tis so concluded on

HAMLET Theres letters seald and my two schoolfellows Whom I will
trust as I will adders fangd They bear the mandate they must sweep
my way And marshal me to knavery Let it work For tis the sport to
have the enginer Hoist with his own petard and t shall go hard But I
will delve one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon O
tis most sweet When in one line two crafts directly meet This man
shall set me packing Ill lug the guts into the neighbour room
Mother good night Indeed this counsellor Is now most still most
secret and most grave Who was in life a foolish peating knave Come
sir to draw toward an end with you Good night mother

 Exit Hamlet dragging out Polonius

KING What Gertrude How does Hamlet

QUEEN Mad as the sea and wind when both contend Which is the
mightier In his lawless fit Behind the arras hearing something stir
Whips out his rapier cries A rat a rat And in this brainish
apprehension kills The unseen good old man

KING O heavy deed It had been so with us had we been there His
liberty is full of threats to all To you yourself to us to everyone
Alas how shall this bloody deed be answerd It will be laid to us
whose providence Should have kept short restraind and out of haunt
This mad young man But so much was our love We would not understand
what was most fit But like the owner of a foul disease To keep it
from divulging let it feed Even on the pith of life Where is he gone

QUEEN To draw apart the body he hath killd Oer whom his very
madness like some ore Among a mineral of metals base Shows itself
pure He weeps for what is done

KING O Gertrude come away The sun no sooner shall the mountains
touch But we will ship him hence and this vile deed We must with all
our majesty and skill Both countenance and excuseHo Guildenstern

demanded of a spongewhat replication should be made by the son of a
king

ROSENCRANTZ Take you me for a sponge my lord

HAMLET Ay sir that soaks up the Kings countenance his rewards his
authorities But such officers do the King best service in the end he
keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to be
last swallowed when he needs what you have gleaned it is but
squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again

ROSENCRANTZ I understand you not my lord

HAMLET I am glad of it A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear

ROSENCRANTZ My lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us

CAPTAIN Truly to speak and with no addition We go to gain a little
patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name To pay five
ducats five I would not farm it Nor will it yield to Norway or the
Pole A ranker rate should it be sold in fee

HAMLET Why then the Polack never will defend it

CAPTAIN Yes it is already garrisond

 Exeunt all but Hamlet

How all occasions do inform against me And spur my dull revenge What
is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and
feed A beast no more Sure he that made us with such large discourse
Looking before and after gave us not That capability and godlike
reason To fust in us unusd Now whether it be Bestial oblivion or
some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on thevent A thought
which quarterd hath but one part wisdom And ever three parts
cowardI do not know Why yet I live to say this things to do Sith I
have cause and will and strength and means To dot Examples gross
as earth exhort me Witness this army of such mass and charge Led by a
delicate and tender prince Whose spirit with divine ambition puffd
Makes mouths at the invisible event Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune death and danger dare Even for an eggshell
Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument But greatly
to find quarrel in a straw When honours at the stake How stand I
then That have a father killd a mother staind Excitements of my
reason and my blood And let all sleep while to my shame I see The
imminent death of twenty thousand men That for a fantasy and trick of
fame Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot Whereon the
numbers cannot try the cause Which is not tomb enough and continent To
hide the slain O from this time forth My thoughts be bloody or be
nothing worth

 Exit

GENTLEMAN She is importunate indeed distract Her mood will needs be
pitied

QUEEN What would she have

GENTLEMAN She speaks much of her father says she hears Theres tricks
i th world and hems and beats her heart Spurns enviously at
straws speaks things in doubt That carry but half sense Her speech
is nothing Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to
collection they aim at it And botch the words up fit to their own
thoughts Which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them
Indeed would make one think there might be thought Though nothing
sure yet much unhappily Twere good she were spoken with for she may
strew Dangerous conjectures in illbreeding minds

QUEEN Let her come in

 Exit Gentleman

To my sick soul as sins true nature is Each toy seems prologue to
some great amiss So full of artless jealousy is guilt It spills
itself in fearing to be spilt

O this is the poison of deep grief it springs All from her fathers
death O Gertrude Gertrude When sorrows come they come not single
spies But in battalions First her father slain Next your son gone
and he most violent author Of his own just remove the people muddied
Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers For good
Polonius death and we have done but greenly In huggermugger to inter
him Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment Without
the which we are pictures or mere beasts Last and as much containing
as all these Her brother is in secret come from France Feeds on his
wonder keeps himself in clouds And wants not buzzers to infect his
ear With pestilent speeches of his fathers death Wherein necessity
of matter beggard Will nothing stick our person to arraign In ear and
ear O my dear Gertrude this Like to a murdering piece in many
places Gives me superfluous death

 A noise within

QUEEN Alack what noise is this

KING Where are my Switzers Let them guard the door

 Enter a Gentleman

What is the matter

GENTLEMAN Save yourself my lord The ocean overpeering of his list
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes in a
riotous head Oerbears your offices The rabble call him lord And as
the world were now but to begin Antiquity forgot custom not known
The ratifiers and props of every word They cry Choose we Laertes
shall be king Caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds

unsmirched brow Of my true mother

KING What is the cause Laertes That thy rebellion looks so
giantlike Let him go Gertrude Do not fear our person Theres such
divinity doth hedge a king That treason can but peep to what it would
Acts little of his willTell me Laertes Why thou art thus

KING Good Laertes If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear
fathers death ist writ in your revenge That sweepstake you will
draw both friend and foe Winner and loser

LAERTES None but his enemies

KING Will you know them then

LAERTES To his good friends thus wide Ill ope my arms And like the
kind liferendering pelican Repast them with my blood

KING Why now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman That I
am guiltless of your fathers death And am most sensibly in grief for

DANES Within Let her come in

LAERTES How now What noise is that

 Reenter Ophelia fantastically dressed with straws and flowers

O heat dry up my brains Tears seven times salt Burn out the sense
and virtue of mine eye By heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight
Till our scale turn the beam O rose of May Dear maid kind sister
sweet Ophelia O heavens ist possible a young maids wits Should be
as mortal as an old mans life Nature is fine in love and where tis
fine It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it

HORATIO Reads Horatio when thou shalt have overlooked this
give these fellows some means to the King They have letters for him
Ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment
gave us chase Finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on a
compelled valour and in the grapple I boarded them On the instant
they got clear of our ship so I alone became their prisoner They have
dealt with me like thieves of mercy But they knew what they did I am
to do a good turn for them Let the King have the letters I have sent
and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death I
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much
too light for the bore of the matter These good fellows will bring
thee where I am Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for
England of them I have much to tell thee Farewell He that thou
knowest thine HAMLET

Come I will give you way for these your letters And dot the
speedier that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them

 Exeunt

SCENE VII Another room in the Castle

 Enter King and Laertes

KING Now must your conscience my acquittance seal And you must put me
in your heart for friend Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
That he which hath your noble father slain Pursud my life

LAERTES It well appears But tell me Why you proceeded not against
these feats So crimeful and so capital in nature As by your safety
wisdom all things else You mainly were stirrd up

KING O for two special reasons Which may to you perhaps seem much
unsinewd But yet to me they are strong The Queen his mother Lives
almost by his looks and for myself My virtue or my plague be it
either which Shes so conjunctive to my life and soul That as the
star moves not but in his sphere I could not but by her The other
motive Why to a public count I might not go Is the great love the
general gender bear him Who dipping all his faults in their
affection Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone Convert
his gyves to graces so that my arrows Too slightly timberd for so
loud a wind Would have reverted to my bow again And not where I had
aimd them

LAERTES And so have I a noble father lost A sister driven into
desperate terms Whose worth if praises may go back again Stood
challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections But my revenge
will come

KING Break not your sleeps for that You must not think That we are
made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with
danger And think it pastime You shortly shall hear more I lovd your
father and we love ourself And that I hope will teach you to
imagine

 Enter a Messenger

How now What news

MESSENGER Letters my lord from Hamlet This to your Majesty this to
the Queen

KING From Hamlet Who brought them

MESSENGER Sailors my lord they say I saw them not They were given
me by Claudio He receivd them Of him that brought them

KING Laertes you shall hear them Leave us

 Exit Messenger

Reads High and mighty you shall know I am set naked on your
kingdom Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes When I
shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasions of my
sudden and more strange return HAMLET

What should this mean Are all the rest come back Or is it some abuse
and no such thing

LAERTES Know you the hand

KING Tis Hamlets character Naked And in a postscript here he
says alone Can you advise me

LAERTES I am lost in it my lord But let him come It warms the very
sickness in my heart That I shall live and tell him to his teeth Thus
diest thou

KING If it be so Laertes As how should it be so How otherwise
Will you be ruld by me

LAERTES Ay my lord So you will not oerrule me to a peace

KING To thine own peace If he be now returnd As checking at his
voyage and that he means No more to undertake it I will work him To
exploit now ripe in my device Under the which he shall not choose but
fall And for his death no wind shall breathe But even his mother
shall uncharge the practice And call it accident

LAERTES My lord I will be ruld The rather if you could devise it so
That I might be the organ

KING It falls right You have been talkd of since your travel much
And that in Hamlets hearing for a quality Wherein they say you shine
Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that
one and that in my regard Of the unworthiest siege

LAERTES What part is that my lord

KING A very riband in the cap of youth Yet needful too for youth no
less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled
age his sables and his weeds Importing health and graveness Two
months since Here was a gentleman of Normandy Ive seen myself and
servd against the French And they can well on horseback but this
gallant Had witchcraft int He grew unto his seat And to such
wondrous doing brought his horse As had he been incorpsd and
deminaturd With the brave beast So far he toppd my thought That I
in forgery of shapes and tricks Come short of what he did

LAERTES A Norman wast

KING A Norman

LAERTES Upon my life Lamond

KING The very same

LAERTES I know him well He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the
nation

KING He made confession of you And gave you such a masterly report
For art and exercise in your defence And for your rapier most
especially That he cried out twould be a sight indeed If one could
match you The scrimers of their nation He swore had neither motion
guard nor eye If you opposd them Sir this report of his Did Hamlet
so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your
sudden coming oer to play with him Now out of this

LAERTES What out of this my lord

KING Laertes was your father dear to you Or are you like the
painting of a sorrow A face without a heart

LAERTES Why ask you this

KING Not that I think you did not love your father But that I know
love is begun by time And that I see in passages of proof Time
qualifies the spark and fire of it There lives within the very flame
of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it And nothing is at a
like goodness still For goodness growing to a pleurisy Dies in his
own too much That we would do We should do when we would for this
would changes And hath abatements and delays as many As there are
tongues are hands are accidents And then this should is like a
spendthrift sigh That hurts by easing But to the quick o thulcer
Hamlet comes back what would you undertake To show yourself your
fathers son in deed More than in words

LAERTES To cut his throat i th church

KING No place indeed should murder sanctuarize Revenge should have
no bounds But good Laertes Will you do this keep close within your
chamber Hamlet returnd shall know you are come home Well put on
those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the
fame The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together And wager on
your heads He being remiss Most generous and free from all
contriving Will not peruse the foils so that with ease Or with a
little shuffling you may choose A sword unbated and in a pass of
practice Requite him for your father

LAERTES I will dot And for that purpose Ill anoint my sword I
bought an unction of a mountebank So mortal that but dip a knife in
it Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare Collected from all
simples that have virtue Under the moon can save the thing from death
This is but scratchd withal Ill touch my point With this contagion
that if I gall him slightly It may be death

KING Lets further think of this Weigh what convenience both of time
and means May fit us to our shape If this should fail And that our
drift look through our bad performance Twere better not assayd
Therefore this project Should have a back or second that might hold If
this did blast in proof Soft let me see Well make a solemn wager on
your cunnings I hat When in your motion you are hot and dry As
make your bouts more violent to that end And that he calls for drink
Ill have prepard him A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping If
he by chance escape your venomd stuck Our purpose may hold there

 Enter Queen

How now sweet Queen

QUEEN One woe doth tread upon anothers heel So fast they follow
Your sisters drownd Laertes

LAERTES Drownd O where

QUEEN There is a willow grows aslant a brook That shows his hoary
leaves in the glassy stream There with fantastic garlands did she make
Of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples That liberal
shepherds give a grosser name But our cold maids do dead mens fingers
call them There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds Clambring to
hang an envious sliver broke When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook Her clothes spread wide And mermaidlike
awhile they bore her up Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes
As one incapable of her own distress Or like a creature native and
indued Unto that element But long it could not be Till that her
garments heavy with their drink Pulld the poor wretch from her
melodious lay To muddy death

LAERTES Alas then she is drownd

QUEEN Drownd drownd

LAERTES Too much of water hast thou poor Ophelia And therefore I
forbid my tears But yet It is our trick nature her custom holds Let
shame say what it will When these are gone The woman will be out
Adieu my lord I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze But
that this folly douts it

 Exit

KING Lets follow Gertrude How much I had to do to calm his rage
Now fear I this will give it start again Therefore lets follow

 Exeunt

FIRST CLOWN Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
seeks her own salvation

SECOND CLOWN I tell thee she is and therefore make her grave
straight The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial

FIRST CLOWN How can that be unless she drowned herself in her own
defence

SECOND CLOWN Why tis found so

FIRST CLOWN It must be se offendendo it cannot be else For here
lies the point if I drown myself wittingly it argues an act and an
act hath three branches It is to act to do and to perform argal
she drowned herself wittingly

SECOND CLOWN Nay but hear you goodman delver

FIRST CLOWN Give me leave Here lies the water good Here stands the
man good If the man go to this water and drown himself it is will
he nill he he goesmark you that But if the water come to him and
drown him he drowns not himself Argal he that is not guilty of his
own death shortens not his own life

SECOND CLOWN But is this law

FIRST CLOWN Ay marry ist crowners quest law

SECOND CLOWN Will you ha the truth ont If this had not been a
gentlewoman she should have been buried out o Christian burial

FIRST CLOWN Why there thou sayst And the more pity that great folk
should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more
than their even Christian Come my spade There is no ancient
gentlemen but gardeners ditchers and gravemakers they hold up
Adams profession

SECOND CLOWN Was he a gentleman

FIRST CLOWN He was the first that ever bore arms

SECOND CLOWN Why he had none

FIRST CLOWN What art a heathen How dost thou understand the
Scripture The Scripture says Adam diggd Could he dig without arms
Ill put another question to thee If thou answerest me not to the
purpose confess thyself

SECOND CLOWN Go to

FIRST CLOWN What is he that builds stronger than either the mason the
shipwright or the carpenter

SECOND CLOWN The gallowsmaker for that frame outlives a thousand
tenants

FIRST CLOWN I like thy wit well in good faith the gallows does well
But how does it well It does well to those that do ill Now thou dost
ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church argal the
gallows may do well to thee Tot again come

SECOND CLOWN Who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or a
carpenter

FIRST CLOWN Ay tell me that and unyoke

SECOND CLOWN Marry now I can tell

FIRST CLOWN Tot

SECOND CLOWN Mass I cannot tell

 Enter Hamlet and Horatio at a distance

FIRST CLOWN Cudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull ass will
not mend his pace with beating and when you are asked this question
next say a gravemaker The houses he makes last till doomsday Go
get thee to Yaughan fetch me a stoup of liquor

 Exit Second Clown

Digs and sings

   In youth when I did love did love Methought it was very sweet To
   contract O the time for a my behove O methought there was
   nothing meet

HAMLET Has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at
gravemaking

HORATIO Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness

HAMLET Tis een so the hand of little employment hath the daintier
sense

FIRST CLOWN Sings But age with his stealing steps Hath clawd me
in his clutch And hath shippd me into the land As if I had never
been such

 Throws up a skull

HAMLET That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once How the
knave jowls it to th ground as if twere Cains jawbone that did the
first murder This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now
oeroffices one that would circumvent God might it not

HORATIO It might my lord

HAMLET Or of a courtier which could say Good morrow sweet lord How
dost thou good lord This might be my lord suchaone that praised
my lord suchaones horse when he meant to beg it might it not

HORATIO Ay my lord

HAMLET Why een so and now my Lady Worms chapless and knocked
about the mazard with a sextons spade Heres fine revolution an we
had the trick to seet Did these bones cost no more the breeding but
to play at loggets with em Mine ache to think ont

FIRST CLOWN Sings A pickaxe and a spade a spade For and a
shroudingsheet O a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is
meet

 Throws up another skull

HAMLET Theres another Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer
Where be his quiddits now his quillets his cases his tenures and
his tricks Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about
the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of
battery Hum This fellow might be ins time a great buyer of land
with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers
his recoveries Is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his
recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt Will his vouchers
vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the
length and breadth of a pair of indentures The very conveyances of his
lands will scarcely lie in this box and must the inheritor himself
have no more ha

HORATIO Not a jot more my lord

HAMLET Is not parchment made of sheepskins

HORATIO Ay my lord and of calfskins too

HAMLET They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that I
will speak to this fellowWhose graves this sir

FIRST CLOWN Mine sir Sings O a pit of clay for to be made For
such a guest is meet

HAMLET I think it be thine indeed for thou liest int

FIRST CLOWN You lie out ont sir and therefore tis not yours For
my part I do not lie int yet it is mine

HAMLET Thou dost lie int to be int and say it is thine Tis for
the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest

FIRST CLOWN Tis a quick lie sir t will away again from me to you

HAMLET What man dost thou dig it for

FIRST CLOWN For no man sir

HAMLET What woman then

FIRST CLOWN For none neither

HAMLET Who is to be buried int

FIRST CLOWN One that was a woman sir but rest her soul shes dead

HAMLET How absolute the knave is We must speak by the card or
equivocation will undo us By the Lord Horatio these three years I
have taken note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibeHow
long hast thou been a gravemaker

FIRST CLOWN Of all the days i th year I came tot that day that our
last King Hamlet oercame Fortinbras

HAMLET How long is that since

FIRST CLOWN Cannot you tell that Every fool can tell that It was the
very day that young Hamlet was bornhe that is mad and sent into
England

HAMLET Ay marry why was he sent into England

FIRST CLOWN Why because he was mad he shall recover his wits there
or if he do not its no great matter there

HAMLET Why

FIRST CLOWN Twill not be seen in him there there the men are as mad
as he

HAMLET How came he mad

FIRST CLOWN Very strangely they say

HAMLET How strangely

FIRST CLOWN Faith een with losing his wits

HAMLET Upon what ground

FIRST CLOWN Why here in Denmark I have been sexton here man and
boy thirty years

HAMLET How long will a man lie i thearth ere he rot

FIRST CLOWN Faith if he be not rotten before he dieas we have many
pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying inhe will last
you some eight year or nine year A tanner will last you nine year

HAMLET Why he more than another

FIRST CLOWN Why sir his hide is so tannd with his trade that he
will keep out water a great while And your water is a sore decayer of
your whoreson dead body Heres a skull now this skull hath lain in
the earth threeandtwenty years

HAMLET Whose was it

FIRST CLOWN A whoreson mad fellows it was Whose do you think it
was

HAMLET Nay I know not

FIRST CLOWN A pestilence on him for a mad rogue A pourd a flagon of
Rhenish on my head once This same skull sir was Yoricks skull the
Kings jester

HAMLET This

FIRST CLOWN Een that

HAMLET Let me see Takes the skull Alas poor Yorick I knew him
Horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy He hath
borne me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my
imagination it is My gorge rises at it Here hung those lips that I
have kissd I know not how oft Where be your gibes now your gambols
your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table
on a roar Not one now to mock your own grinning Quite chopfallen
Now get you to my ladys chamber and tell her let her paint an inch
thick to this favour she must come Make her laugh at thatPrythee
Horatio tell me one thing

HORATIO Whats that my lord

HAMLET Dost thou think Alexander looked o this fashion i thearth

HORATIO Een so

HAMLET And smelt so Pah

 Throws down the skull

HORATIO Een so my lord

HAMLET To what base uses we may return Horatio Why may not
imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping
a bunghole

HORATIO Twere to consider too curiously to consider so

HAMLET No faith not a jot But to follow him thither with modesty
enough and likelihood to lead it as thus Alexander died Alexander
was buried Alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of earth
we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they
not stop a beerbarrel Imperious Caesar dead and turnd to clay
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away O that that earth which kept
the world in awe Should patch a wall texpel the winters flaw But
soft but soft aside Here comes the King

 Enter priests c in procession the corpse of Ophelia Laertes and
 Mourners following King Queen their Trains c

The Queen the courtiers Who is that they follow And with such maimed
rites This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand
Fordo it own life Twas of some estate Couch we awhile and mark

 Retiring with Horatio

LAERTES What ceremony else

HAMLET That is Laertes a very noble youth Mark

LAERTES What ceremony else

PRIEST Her obsequies have been as far enlargd As we have warranties
Her death was doubtful And but that great command oersways the order
She should in ground unsanctified have lodgd Till the last trumpet
For charitable prayers Shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on
her Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites Her maiden strewments
and the bringing home Of bell and burial

LAERTES Must there no more be done

PRIEST No more be done We should profane the service of the dead To
sing sage requiem and such rest to her As to peaceparted souls

LAERTES Lay her i thearth And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring I tell thee churlish priest A ministring angel
shall my sister be When thou liest howling

HAMLET What the fair Ophelia

QUEEN Scattering flowers Sweets to the sweet Farewell I hopd
thou shouldst have been my Hamlets wife I thought thy bridebed to
have deckd sweet maid And not have strewd thy grave

LAERTES O treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose
wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprivd thee of Hold off the
earth a while Till I have caught her once more in mine arms Leaps
into the grave Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead Till of
this flat a mountain you have made To oertop old Pelion or the skyish
head Of blue Olympus

HAMLET Advancing What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis
whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wandring stars and makes them
stand Like wonderwounded hearers This is I Hamlet the Dane Leaps
into the grave

LAERTES Grappling with him The devil take thy soul

HAMLET Thou prayst not well I prythee take thy fingers from my
throat For though I am not splenative and rash Yet have I in me
something dangerous Which let thy wiseness fear Away thy hand

KING Pluck them asunder

QUEEN Hamlet Hamlet

All Gentlemen

HORATIO Good my lord be quiet

 The Attendants part them and they come out of the grave

HAMLET Why I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids
will no longer wag

QUEEN O my son what theme

HAMLET I lovd Ophelia forty thousand brothers Could not with all
their quantity of love Make up my sum What wilt thou do for her

KING O he is mad Laertes

QUEEN For love of God forbear him

HAMLET Swounds show me what thoult do Woult weep woult fight
woult fast woult tear thyself Woult drink up eisel eat a
crocodile Ill dot Dost thou come here to whine To outface me with
leaping in her grave Be buried quick with her and so will I And if
thou prate of mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us till
our ground Singeing his pate against the burning zone Make Ossa like
a wart Nay an thoult mouth Ill rant as well as thou

QUEEN This is mere madness And thus awhile the fit will work on him
Anon as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are
disclosd His silence will sit drooping

HAMLET Hear you sir What is the reason that you use me thus I lovd
you ever But it is no matter Let Hercules himself do what he may The
cat will mew and dog will have his day

 Exit

KING I pray thee good Horatio wait upon him

 Exit Horatio

To Laertes Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech
Well put the matter to the present push Good Gertrude set some
watch over your son This grave shall have a living monument An hour
of quiet shortly shall we see Till then in patience our proceeding be

 Exeunt

SCENE II A hall in the Castle

 Enter Hamlet and Horatio

HAMLET So much for this sir Now let me see the other You do
remember all the circumstance

HORATIO Remember it my lord

HAMLET Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not
let me sleep Methought I lay Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes
Rashly And praisd be rashness for itlet us know Our indiscretion
sometime serves us well When our deep plots do pall and that should
teach us Theres a divinity that shapes our ends Roughhew them how we
will

HORATIO That is most certain

HAMLET Up from my cabin My seagown scarfd about me in the dark
Gropd I to find out them had my desire Fingerd their packet and in
fine withdrew To mine own room again making so bold My fears
forgetting manners to unseal Their grand commission where I found
Horatio Oh royal knavery an exact command Larded with many several
sorts of reasons Importing Denmarks health and Englands too With
ho such bugs and goblins in my life That on the supervise no leisure
bated No not to stay the grinding of the axe My head should be
struck off

HORATIO Ist possible

HAMLET Heres the commission read it at more leisure But wilt thou
hear me how I did proceed

HORATIO I beseech you

HAMLET Being thus benetted round with villanies Or I could make a
prologue to my brains They had begun the playI sat me down Devisd
a new commission wrote it fair I once did hold it as our statists
do A baseness to write fair and labourd much How to forget that
learning but sir now It did me yeomans service Wilt thou know The
effect of what I wrote

HORATIO Ay good my lord

HAMLET An earnest conjuration from the King As England was his
faithful tributary As love between them like the palm might flourish
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma tween
their amities And many suchlike ases of great charge That on the
view and know of these contents Without debatement further more or
less He should the bearers put to sudden death Not shrivingtime
allowd

HORATIO How was this seald

HAMLET Why even in that was heaven ordinant I had my fathers signet
in my purse Which was the model of that Danish seal Folded the writ
up in the form of the other Subscribd it gavet thimpression
placd it safely The changeling never known Now the next day Was our
seafight and what to this was sequent Thou knowst already

HORATIO So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go tot

HAMLET Why man they did make love to this employment They are not
near my conscience their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow
Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell
incensed points Of mighty opposites

HORATIO Why what a king is this

HAMLET Does it not thinkst thee stand me now upon He that hath
killd my king and whord my mother Poppd in between thelection and
my hopes Thrown out his angle for my proper life And with such
cozenageist not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm And
ist not to be damnd To let this canker of our nature come In further
evil

HORATIO It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue
of the business there

HAMLET It will be short The interim is mine And a mans lifes no
more than to say One But I am very sorry good Horatio That to
Laertes I forgot myself For by the image of my cause I see The
portraiture of his Ill court his favours But sure the bravery of his
grief did put me Into a towring passion

HORATIO Peace who comes here

 Enter Osric

OSRIC Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark

HAMLET I humbly thank you sir Dost know this waterfly

HORATIO No my good lord

HAMLET Thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him He
hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his
crib shall stand at the kings mess tis a chough but as I say
spacious in the possession of dirt

OSRIC Sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I should impart a
thing to you from his Majesty

HAMLET I will receive it with all diligence of spirit Put your bonnet
to his right use tis for the head

OSRIC I thank your lordship tis very hot

HAMLET No believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly

OSRIC It is indifferent cold my lord indeed

HAMLET Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion

OSRIC Exceedingly my lord it is very sultryas twereI cannot tell
how But my lord his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid
a great wager on your head Sir this is the matter

HAMLET I beseech you remember

 Hamlet moves him to put on his hat

OSRIC Nay in good faith for mine ease in good faith Sir here is
newly come to court Laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of
most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing
Indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of
gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a
gentleman would see

HAMLET Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though I know
to divide him inventorially would dizzy tharithmetic of memory and
yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail But in the verity
of extolment I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion
of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his
semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage
nothing more

OSRIC Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him

HAMLET The concernancy sir Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
rawer breath

OSRIC Sir

HORATIO Ist not possible to understand in another tongue You will
dot sir really

HAMLET What imports the nomination of this gentleman

OSRIC Of Laertes

HORATIO His purse is empty already alls golden words are spent

HAMLET Of him sir

OSRIC I know you are not ignorant

HAMLET I would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not
much approve me Well sir

OSRIC You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is

HAMLET I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in
excellence but to know a man well were to know himself

OSRIC I mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him
by them in his meed hes unfellowed

HAMLET Whats his weapon

OSRIC Rapier and dagger

HAMLET Thats two of his weapons But well

OSRIC The King sir hath wagerd with him six Barbary horses against
the which he has imponed as I take it six French rapiers and
poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so Three of the
carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the
hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit

HAMLET What call you the carriages

HORATIO I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done

OSRIC The carriages sir are the hangers

HAMLET The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry
cannon by our sides I would it might be hangers till then But on Six
Barbary horses against six French swords their assigns and three
liberal conceited carriages thats the French bet against the Danish
Why is this all imponed as you call it

OSRIC The King sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and
him he shall not exceed you three hits He hath laid on twelve for
nine And it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would
vouchsafe the answer

HAMLET How if I answer no

OSRIC I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial

HAMLET Sir I will walk here in the hall If it please his Majesty it
is the breathing time of day with me Let the foils be brought the
gentleman willing and the King hold his purpose I will win for him if
I can if not I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits

OSRIC Shall I redeliver you een so

HAMLET To this effect sir after what flourish your nature will

OSRIC I commend my duty to your lordship

HAMLET Yours yours

 Exit Osric

He does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else fors
turn

HORATIO This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head

HAMLET He did comply with his dug before he suckd it Thus has
heand many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes
on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a
kind of yeasty collection which carries them through and through the
most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial
the bubbles are out

 Enter a Lord

LORD My lord his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric who
brings back to him that you attend him in the hall He sends to know if
your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer
time

HAMLET I am constant to my purposes they follow the Kings pleasure
If his fitness speaks mine is ready Now or whensoever provided I be
so able as now

LORD The King and Queen and all are coming down

HAMLET In happy time

LORD The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes
before you fall to play

HAMLET She well instructs me

 Exit Lord

HORATIO You will lose this wager my lord

HAMLET I do not think so Since he went into France I have been in
continual practice I shall win at the odds But thou wouldst not think
how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter

HORATIO Nay good my lord

HAMLET It is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
would perhaps trouble a woman

HORATIO If your mind dislike anything obey it I will forestall their
repair hither and say you are not fit

HAMLET Not a whit we defy augury Theres a special providence in the
fall of a sparrow If it be now tis not to come if it be not to
come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come The readiness
is all Since no man has aught of what he leaves what ist to leave
betimes

 Enter King Queen Laertes Lords Osric and Attendants with foils c

KING Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me

 The King puts Laertess hand into Hamlets

HAMLET Give me your pardon sir I have done you wrong But pardont
as you are a gentleman This presence knows and you must needs have
heard How I am punishd with sore distraction What I have done That
might your nature honour and exception Roughly awake I here proclaim
was madness Wast Hamlet wrongd Laertes Never Hamlet If Hamlet from
himself be taen away And when hes not himself does wrong Laertes
Then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it Who does it then His
madness Ift be so Hamlet is of the faction that is wrongd His
madness is poor Hamlets enemy Sir in this audience Let my
disclaiming from a purposd evil Free me so far in your most generous
thoughts That I have shot my arrow oer the house And hurt my brother

LAERTES I am satisfied in nature Whose motive in this case should
stir me most To my revenge But in my terms of honour I stand aloof
and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters of known honour I
have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungord But till
that time I do receive your offerd love like love And will not wrong
it

HAMLET I embrace it freely And will this brothers wager frankly
play Give us the foils come on

LAERTES Come one for me

HAMLET Ill be your foil Laertes in mine ignorance Your skill shall
like a star i th darkest night Stick fiery off indeed

LAERTES You mock me sir

HAMLET No by this hand

KING Give them the foils young Osric Cousin Hamlet You know the
wager

HAMLET Very well my lord Your Grace has laid the odds o the weaker
side

KING I do not fear it I have seen you both But since he is betterd
we have therefore odds

LAERTES This is too heavy Let me see another

HAMLET This likes me well These foils have all a length

 They prepare to play

OSRIC Ay my good lord

KING Set me the stoups of wine upon that table If Hamlet give the
first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange Let all
the battlements their ordnance fire The King shall drink to Hamlets
better breath And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that
which four successive kings In Denmarks crown have worn Give me the
cups And let the kettle to the trumpet speak The trumpet to the
cannoneer without The cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth
Now the King drinks to Hamlet Come begin And you the judges bear
a wary eye

HAMLET Come on sir

LAERTES Come my lord

 They play

HAMLET One

LAERTES No

HAMLET Judgment

OSRIC A hit a very palpable hit

LAERTES Well again

KING Stay give me drink Hamlet this pearl is thine Heres to thy
health

 Trumpets sound and cannon shot off within

Give him the cup

HAMLET Ill play this bout first set it by awhile

 They play

Come Another hit what say you


LAERTES A touch a touch I do confess

KING Our son shall win

QUEEN Hes fat and scant of breath Here Hamlet take my napkin rub
thy brows The Queen carouses to thy fortune Hamlet

HAMLET Good madam

KING Gertrude do not drink

QUEEN I will my lord I pray you pardon me

KING Aside It is the poisond cup it is too late

HAMLET I dare not drink yet madam By and by

QUEEN Come let me wipe thy face

LAERTES My lord Ill hit him now

KING I do not thinkt

LAERTES Aside And yet tis almost gainst my conscience

HAMLET Come for the third Laertes You do but dally I pray you pass
with your best violence I am afeard you make a wanton of me

LAERTES Say you so Come on

 They play

OSRIC Nothing neither way

LAERTES Have at you now

 Laertes wounds Hamlet then in scuffling they change rapiers and
 Hamlet wounds Laertes

KING Part them they are incensd

HAMLET Nay come again

 The Queen falls

OSRIC Look to the Queen there ho

HORATIO They bleed on both sides How is it my lord

OSRIC How ist Laertes

LAERTES Why as a woodcock to my own springe Osric I am justly
killd with mine own treachery

HAMLET How does the Queen

KING She swoons to see them bleed

QUEEN No no the drink the drink O my dear Hamlet The drink the
drink I am poisond

 Dies

HAMLET O villany Ho Let the door be lockd Treachery Seek it out

 Laertes falls

LAERTES It is here Hamlet Hamlet thou art slain No medicine in the
world can do thee good In thee there is not half an hour of life The
treacherous instrument is in thy hand Unbated and envenomd The foul
practice Hath turnd itself on me Lo here I lie Never to rise again
Thy mothers poisond I can no more The King the Kings to blame

HAMLET The point envenomd too Then venom to thy work

 Stabs the King

OSRIC and LORDS Treason treason

KING O yet defend me friends I am but hurt

HAMLET Here thou incestuous murderous damned Dane Drink off this
potion Is thy union here Follow my mother

 King dies

LAERTES He is justly servd It is a poison temperd by himself
Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet Mine and my fathers death
come not upon thee Nor thine on me

 Dies

HAMLET Heaven make thee free of it I follow thee I am dead Horatio
Wretched Queen adieu You that look pale and tremble at this chance
That are but mutes or audience to this act Had I but timeas this
fell sergeant death Is strict in his arrestO I could tell you
But let it be Horatio I am dead Thou livst report me and my cause
aright To the unsatisfied

HORATIO Never believe it I am more an antique Roman than a Dane
Heres yet some liquor left

HAMLET As thart a man Give me the cup Let go by Heaven Ill
havet O good Horatio what a wounded name Things standing thus
unknown shall live behind me If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile And in this harsh world draw thy
breath in pain To tell my story

 March afar off and shot within

What warlike noise is this

OSRIC Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland To the
ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley

HAMLET O I die Horatio The potent poison quite oercrows my
spirit I cannot live to hear the news from England But I do prophesy
thelection lights On Fortinbras He has my dying voice So tell him
with the occurrents more and less Which have solicited The rest is
silence

 Dies

HORATIO Now cracks a noble heart Good night sweet prince And
flights of angels sing thee to thy rest Why does the drum come hither

 March within

 Enter Fortinbras the English Ambassadors and others

FORTINBRAS Where is this sight

HORATIO What is it you would see If aught of woe or wonder cease
your search

FORTINBRAS This quarry cries on havoc O proud death What feast is
toward in thine eternal cell That thou so many princes at a shot So
bloodily hast struck

FIRST AMBASSADOR The sight is dismal And our affairs from England
come too late The ears are senseless that should give us hearing To
tell him his commandment is fulfilld That Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are dead Where should we have our thanks

HORATIO Not from his mouth Had it thability of life to thank you He
never gave commandment for their death But since so jump upon this
bloody question You from the Polack wars and you from England Are
here arrivd give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to
the view And let me speak to th yet unknowing world How these things
came about So shall you hear Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts Of
accidental judgments casual slaughters Of deaths put on by cunning
and forcd cause And in this upshot purposes mistook Falln on the
inventors heads All this can I Truly deliver

FORTINBRAS Let us haste to hear it And call the noblest to the
audience For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune I have some rights
of memory in this kingdom Which now to claim my vantage doth invite
me

HORATIO Of that I shall have also cause to speak And from his mouth
whose voice will draw on more But let this same be presently
performd Even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance On
plots and errors happen

FORTINBRAS Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage
For he was likely had he been put on To have provd most royally and
for his passage The soldiers music and the rites of war Speak loudly
for him Take up the bodies Such a sight as this Becomes the field
but here shows much amiss Go bid the soldiers shoot

 A dead march

 Exeunt bearing off the bodies after which a peal of ordnance is
 shot off

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included  Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work  The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001  10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Executive Directors Notes

In addition to the notes below and so you will NOT think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected here are the first few lines of Hamlet as they
are presented herein

  Barnardo Whos there
  Fran Nay answer me Stand  vnfold
your selfe

   Bar Long liue the King



As I understand it the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner   

The answer is that they MAY have packed liue into a cliche at a
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in
place of some ws etc  This was a common practice of the day
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to

You will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as I
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a
very high place in the canon of Shakespeare  My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous
for signing his name with several different spellings

So please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file  you may see errors
that are not errors   

So  with this caveat  we have NOT changed the canon errors
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeares The Life of
Henry the Fift

Scanners Notes What this is and isnt  This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeares first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text

The elongated Ss have been changed to small ss and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae  I have left the spelling
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text  I have corrected some spelling mistakes I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeares First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template typos and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them  Everything within
brackets  is what I have added  So if you dont like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare

Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio  So there may
be differences other than what I have mentioned above between
this and other first folio editions  This is due to the printers
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run  The proof run wasnt thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies  This is just the way it is
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions best pages

If you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors  I wish to make this the best
etext possible  My email address for right now are haraddaaolcom
and davidrinconnectcom  I hope that you enjoy this

The Life of Henry the Fift

Enter Prologue

O For a Muse of Fire that would ascend
The brightest Heauen of Inuention
A Kingdome for a Stage Princes to Act
And Monarchs to behold the swelling Scene
Then should the Warlike Harry like himselfe
Assume the Port of Mars and at his heeles
Leasht in like Hounds should Famine Sword and Fire
Crouch for employment But pardon Gentles all
The flat vnraysed Spirits that hath dard
On this vnworthy Scaffold to bring forth
So great an Obiect Can this CockPit hold
The vastie fields of France Or may we cramme
Within this Woodden O the very Caskes
That did affright the Ayre at Agincourt
O pardon since a crooked Figure may
Attest in little place a Million
And let vs Cyphers to this great Accompt
On your imaginarie Forces worke
Suppose within the Girdle of these Walls
Are now confind two mightie Monarchies
Whose high vpreared and abutting Fronts
The perillous narrow Ocean parts asunder
Peece out our imperfections with your thoughts
Into a thousand parts diuide one Man
And make imaginarie Puissance
Thinke when we talke of Horses that you see them
Printing their prowd Hoofes ith receiuing Earth
For tis your thoughts that now must deck our Kings
Carry them here and there Iumping ore Times
Turning th accomplishment of many yeeres
Into an Howreglasse for the which supplie
Admit me Chorus to this Historie
Who Prologuelike your humble patience pray
Gently to heare kindly to iudge our Play
Enter


Actus Primus Scoena Prima

Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely

  BishCant My Lord Ile tell you that selfe Bill is vrgd
Which in th eleuenth yere of y last Kings reign
Was like and had indeed against vs past
But that the scambling and vnquiet time
Did push it out of farther question

   BishEly But how my Lord shall we resist it now
  BishCant It must be thought on if it passe against vs
We loose the better halfe of our Possession
For all the Temporall Lands which men deuout
By Testament haue giuen to the Church
Would they strip from vs being valud thus
As much as would maintaine to the Kings honor
Full fifteene Earles and fifteene hundred Knights
Six thousand and two hundred good Esquires
And to reliefe of Lazars and weake age
Of indigent faint Soules past corporall toyle
A hundred Almeshouses right well supplyd
And to the Coffers of the King beside
A thousand pounds by th yeere Thus runs the Bill

   BishEly This would drinke deepe

   BishCant Twould drinke the Cup and all

   BishEly But what preuention
  BishCant The King is full of grace and faire regard

   BishEly And a true louer of the holy Church

   BishCant The courses of his youth promisd it not
The breath no sooner left his Fathers body
But that his wildnesse mortifyd in him
Seemd to dye too yea at that very moment
Consideration like an Angell came
And whipt th offending Adam out of him
Leauing his body as a Paradise
T inuelop and containe Celestiall Spirits
Neuer was such a sodaine Scholler made
Neuer came Reformation in a Flood
With such a heady currance scowring faults
Nor neuer Hidraheaded Wilfulnesse
So soone did loose his Seat and all at once
As in this King

   BishEly We are blessed in the Change

   BishCant Heare him but reason in Diuinitie
And alladmiring with an inward wish
You would desire the King were made a Prelate
Heare him debate of Commonwealth Affaires
You would say it hath been all in all his study
List his discourse of Warre and you shall heare
A fearefull Battaile rendred you in Musique
Turne him to any Cause of Pollicy
The Gordian Knot of it he will vnloose
Familiar as his Garter that when he speakes
The Ayre a Charterd Libertine is still
And the mute Wonder lurketh in mens eares
To steale his sweet and honyed Sentences
So that the Art and Practique part of Life
Must be the Mistresse to this Theorique
Which is a wonder how his Grace should gleane it
Since his addiction was to Courses vaine
His Companies vnletterd rude and shallow
His Houres filld vp with Ryots Banquets Sports
And neuer noted in him any studie
Any retyrement any sequestration
From open Haunts and Popularitie

   BEly The Strawberry growes vnderneath the Nettle
And holesome Berryes thriue and ripen best
Neighbourd by Fruit of baser qualitie
And so the Prince obscurd his Contemplation
Vnder the Veyle of Wildnesse which no doubt
Grew like the Summer Grasse fastest by Night
Vnseene yet cressiue in his facultie

   BCant It must be so for Miracles are ceast
And therefore we must needes admit the meanes
How things are perfected

   BEly But my good Lord
How now for mittigation of this Bill
Vrgd by the Commons doth his Maiestie
Incline to it or no
  BCant He seemes indifferent
Or rather swaying more vpon our part
Then cherishing th exhibiters against vs
For I haue made an offer to his Maiestie
Vpon our Spirituall Conuocation
And in regard of Causes now in hand
Which I haue opend to his Grace at large
As touching France to giue a greater Summe
Then euer at one time the Clergie yet
Did to his Predecessors part withall

   BEly How did this offer seeme receiud my Lord
  BCant With good acceptance of his Maiestie
Saue that there was not time enough to heare
As I perceiud his Grace would faine haue done
The seueralls and vnhidden passages
Of his true Titles to some certaine Dukedomes
And generally to the Crowne and Seat of France
Deriud from Edward his great Grandfather

   BEly What was th impediment that broke this off
  BCant The French Embassador vpon that instant
Craud audience and the howre I thinke is come
To giue him hearing Is it foure a Clock
  BEly It is

   BCant Then goe we in to know his Embassie
Which I could with a ready guesse declare
Before the Frenchman speake a word of it

   BEly Ile wait vpon you and I long to heare it

Exeunt

Enter the King Humfrey Bedford Clarence Warwick
Westmerland and
Exeter

  King Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury
  Exeter Not here in presence

   King Send for him good Vnckle

   Westm Shall we call in th Ambassador my Liege
  King Not yet my Cousin we would be resolud
Before we heare him of some things of weight
That taske our thoughts concerning vs and France
Enter two Bishops

  BCant God and his Angels guard your sacred Throne
And make you long become it

   King Sure we thanke you
My learned Lord we pray you to proceed
And iustly and religiously vnfold
Why the Law Salike that they haue in France
Or should or should not barre vs in our Clayme
And God forbid my deare and faithfull Lord
That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
Or nicely charge your vnderstanding Soule
With opening Titles miscreate whose right
Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth
For God doth know how many now in health
Shall drop their blood in approbation
Of what your reuerence shall incite vs to
Therefore take heed how you impawne our Person
How you awake our sleeping Sword of Warre
We charge you in the Name of God take heed
For neuer two such Kingdomes did contend
Without much fall of blood whose guiltlesse drops
Are euery one a Woe a sore Complaint
Gainst him whose wrongs giues edge vnto the Swords
That makes such waste in briefe mortalitie
Vnder this Coniuration speake my Lord
For we will heare note and beleeue in heart
That what you speake is in your Conscience washt
As pure as sinne with Baptisme

   BCan Then heare me gracious Soueraign  you Peers
That owe your selues your liues and seruices
To this Imperiall Throne There is no barre
To make against your Highnesse Clayme to France
But this which they produce from Pharamond
In terram Salicam Mulieres ne succedant
No Woman shall succeed in Salike Land
Which Salike Land the French vniustly gloze
To be the Realme of France and Pharamond
The founder of this Law and Female Barre
Yet their owne Authors faithfully affirme
That the Land Salike is in Germanie
Betweene the Flouds of Sala and of Elue
Where Charles the Great hauing subdud the Saxons
There left behind and settled certaine French
Who holding in disdaine the German Women
For some dishonest manners of their life
Establisht then this Law to wit No Female
Should be Inheritrix in Salike Land
Which Salike as I said twixt Elue and Sala
Is at this day in Germanie calld Meisen
Then doth it well appeare the Salike Law
Was not deuised for the Realme of France
Nor did the French possesse the Salike Land
Vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres
After defunction of King Pharamond
Idly supposd the founder of this Law
Who died within the yeere of our Redemption
Foure hundred twentie six and Charles the Great
Subdud the Saxons and did seat the French
Beyond the Riuer Sala in the yeere
Eight hundred fiue Besides their Writers say
King Pepin which deposed Childerike
Did as Heire Generall being descended
Of Blithild which was Daughter to King Clothair
Make Clayme and Title to the Crowne of France
Hugh Capet also who vsurpt the Crowne
Of Charles the Duke of Loraine sole Heire male
Of the true Line and Stock of Charles the Great
To find his Title with some shewes of truth
Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
Conueyd himselfe as th Heire to th Lady Lingare
Daughter to Charlemaine who was the Sonne
To Lewes the Emperour and Lewes the Sonne
Of Charles the Great also King Lewes the Tenth
Who was sole Heire to the Vsurper Capet
Could not keepe quiet in his conscience
Wearing the Crowne of France till satisfied
That faire Queene Isabel his Grandmother
Was Lineall of the Lady Ermengare
Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Loraine
By the which Marriage the Lyne of Charles the Great
Was revnited to the Crowne of France
So that as cleare as is the Summers Sunne
King Pepins Title and Hugh Capets Clayme
King Lewes his satisfaction all appeare
To hold in Right and Title of the Female
So doe the Kings of France vnto this day
Howbeit they would hold vp this Salique Law
To barre your Highnesse clayming from the Female
And rather chuse to hide them in a Net
Then amply to imbarre their crooked Titles
Vsurpt from you and your Progenitors

   King May I with right and conscience make this claim
  BishCant The sinne vpon my head dread Soueraigne
For in the Booke of Numbers is it writ
When the man dyes let the Inheritance
Descend vnto the Daughter Gracious Lord
Stand for your owne vnwind your bloody Flagge
Looke back into your mightie Ancestors
Goe my dread Lord to your great Grandsires Tombe
From whom you clayme inuoke his Warlike Spirit
And your Great Vnckles Edward the Black Prince
Who on the French ground playd a Tragedie
Making defeat on the full Power of France
Whiles his most mightie Father on a Hill
Stood smiling to behold his Lyons Whelpe
Forrage in blood of French Nobilitie
O Noble English that could entertaine
With halfe their Forces the full pride of France
And let another halfe stand laughing by
All out of worke and cold for action

   Bish Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
And with your puissant Arme renew their Feats
You are their Heire you sit vpon their Throne
The Blood and Courage that renowned them
Runs in your Veines and my thricepuissant Liege
Is in the very MayMorne of his Youth
Ripe for Exploits and mightie Enterprises

   Exe Your Brother Kings and Monarchs of the Earth
Doe all expect that you should rowse your selfe
As did the former Lyons of your Blood

   West They know your Grace hath cause and means and might
So hath your Highnesse neuer King of England
Had Nobles richer and more loyall Subiects
Whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in England
And lye pauilliond in the fields of France

   BishCan O let their bodyes follow my deare Liege
With Bloods and Sword and Fire to win your Right
In ayde whereof we of the Spiritualtie
Will rayse your Highnesse such a mightie Summe
As neuer did the Clergie at one time
Bring in to any of your Ancestors

   King We must not onely arme t inuade the French
But lay downe our proportions to defend
Against the Scot who will make roade vpon vs
With all aduantages

   BishCan They of those Marches gracious Soueraign
Shall be a Wall sufficient to defend
Our inland from the pilfering Borderers

   King We do not meane the coursing snatchers onely
But feare the maine intendment of the Scot
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs
For you shall reade that my great Grandfather
Neuer went with his forces into France
But that the Scot on his vnfurnisht Kingdome
Came pouring like the Tyde into a breach
With ample and brim fulnesse of his force
Galling the gleaned Land with hot Assayes
Girding with grieuous siege Castles and Townes
That England being emptie of defence
Hath shooke and trembled at th ill neighbourhood

   BCan She hath bin then more feard then harmd my Liege
For heare her but exampld by her selfe
When all her Cheualrie hath been in France
And shee a mourning Widdow of her Nobles
Shee hath her selfe not onely well defended
But taken and impounded as a Stray
The King of Scots whom shee did send to France
To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner Kings
And make their Chronicle as rich with prayse
As is the Owse and bottome of the Sea
With sunken Wrack and sumlesse Treasuries

   BishEly But theres a saying very old and true
If that you will France win then with Scotland first begin
For once the Eagle England being in prey
To her vnguarded Nest the Weazell Scot
Comes sneaking and so sucks her Princely Egges
Playing the Mouse in absence of the Cat
To tame and hauocke more then she can eate

   Exet It followes then the Cat must stay at home
Yet that is but a crushd necessity
Since we haue lockes to safegard necessaries
And pretty traps to catch the petty theeues
While that the Armed hand doth fight abroad
Th aduised head defends it selfe at home
For Gouernment though high and low and lower
Put into parts doth keepe in one consent
Congreeing in a full and natural close
Like Musicke

   Cant Therefore doth heauen diuide
The state of man in diuers functions
Setting endeuour in continual motion
To which is fixed as an ayme or butt
Obedience for so worke the Hony Bees
Creatures that by a rule in Nature teach
The Act of Order to a peopled Kingdome
They haue a King and Officers of sorts
Where some like Magistrates correct at home
Others like Merchants venter Trade abroad
Others like Souldiers armed in their stings
Make boote vpon the Summers Veluet buddes
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
To the Tentroyal of their Emperor
Who busied in his Maiesties surueyes
The singing Masons building roofes of Gold
The ciuil Citizens kneading vp the hony
The poore Mechanicke Porters crowding in
Their heauy burthens at his narrow gate
The sadeyd Iustice with his surly humme
Deliuering ore to Executors pale
The lazie yawning Drone I this inferre
That many things hauing full reference
To one consent may worke contrariously
As many Arrowes loosed seuerall wayes
Come to one marke as many wayes meet in one towne
As many fresh streames meet in one salt sea
As many Lynes close in the Dials center
So may a thousand actions once a foote
And in one purpose and be all well borne
Without defeat Therefore to France my Liege
Diuide your happy England into foure
Whereof take you one quarter into France
And you withall shall make all Gallia shake
If we with thrice such powers left at home
Cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge
Let vs be worried and our Nation lose
The name of hardinesse and policie

   King Call in the Messengers sent from the Dolphin
Now are we well resolud and by Gods helpe
And yours the noble sinewes of our power
France being ours weel bend it to our Awe
Or breake it all to peeces Or there weel sit
Ruling in large and ample Emperie
Ore France and all her almost Kingly Dukedomes
Or lay these bones in an vnworthy Vrne
Tomblesse with no remembrance ouer them
Either our History shall with full mouth
Speake freely of our Acts or else our graue
Like Turkish mute shall haue a tonguelesse mouth
Not worshipt with a waxen Epitaph
Enter Ambassadors of France

Now are we well prepard to know the pleasure
Of our faire Cosin Dolphin for we heare
Your greeting is from him not from the King

   Amb Mayt please your Maiestie to giue vs leaue
Freely to render what we haue in charge
Or shall we sparingly shew you farre off
The Dolphins meaning and our Embassie

   King We are no Tyrant but a Christian King
Vnto whose grace our passion is as subiect
As is our wretches fettred in our prisons
Therefore with franke and with vncurbed plainnesse
Tell vs the Dolphins minde

   Amb Thus than in few
Your Highnesse lately sending into France
Did claime some certaine Dukedomes in the right
Of your great Predecessor King Edward the third
In answer of which claime the Prince our Master
Sayes that you sauour too much of your youth
And bids you be aduisd Theres nought in France
That can be with a nimble Galliard wonne
You cannot reuell into Dukedomes there
He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
This Tun of Treasure and in lieu of this
Desires you let the dukedomes that you claime
Heare no more of you This the Dolphin speakes

   King What Treasure Vncle
  Exe Tennis balles my Liege

   Kin We are glad the Dolphin is so pleasant with vs
His Present and your paines we thanke you for
When we haue matcht our Rackets to these Balles
We will in France by Gods grace play a set
Shall strike his fathers Crowne into the hazard
Tell him he hath made a match with such a Wrangler
That all the Courts of France will be disturbd
With Chaces And we vnderstand him well
How he comes ore vs with our wilder dayes
Not measuring what vse we made of them
We neuer valewd this poore seate of England
And therefore liuing hence did giue our selfe
To barbarous license As tis euer common
That men are merriest when they are from home
But tell the Dolphin I will keepe my State
Be like a King and shew my sayle of Greatnesse
When I do rowse me in my Throne of France
For that I haue layd by my Maiestie
And plodded like a man for working dayes
But I will rise there with so full a glorie
That I will dazle all the eyes of France
Yea strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs
And tell the pleasant Prince this Mocke of his
Hath turnd his balles to Gunstones and his soule
Shall stand sore charged for the wastefull vengeance
That shall flye with them for many a thousand widows
Shall this his Mocke mocke out of their deer husbands
Mocke mothers from their sonnes mock Castles downe
And some are yet vngotten and vnborne
That shal haue cause to curse the Dolphins scorne
But this lyes all within the wil of God
To whom I do appeale and in whose name
Tel you the Dolphin I am comming on
To venge me as I may and to put forth
My rightfull hand in a welhallowd cause
So get you hence in peace And tell the Dolphin
His Iest will sauour but of shallow wit
When thousands weepe more then did laugh at it
Conuey them with safe conduct Fare you well

Exeunt Ambassadors

  Exe This was a merry Message

   King We hope to make the Sender blush at it
Therefore my Lords omit no happy howre
That may giue furthrance to our Expedition
For we haue now no thought in vs but France
Saue those to God that runne before our businesse
Therefore let our proportions for these Warres
Be soone collected and all things thought vpon
That may with reasonable swiftnesse adde
More Feathers to our Wings for God before
Weele chide this Dolphin at his fathers doore
Therefore let euery man now taske his thought
That this faire Action may on foot be brought

Now all the Youth of England are on fire
And silken Dalliance in the Wardrobe lyes
Now thriue the Armorers and Honors thought
Reignes solely in the breast of euery man
They sell the Pasture now to buy the Horse
Following the Mirror of all Christian Kings
With winged heeles as English Mercuries
For now sits Expectation in the Ayre
And hides a Sword from Hilts vnto the Point
With Crownes Imperiall Crownes and Coronets
Promisd to Harry and his followers
The French aduisd by good intelligence
Of this most dreadfull preparation
Shake in their feare and with pale Pollicy
Seeke to diuert the English purposes
O England Modell to thy inward Greatnesse
Like little Body with a mightie Heart
What mightst thou do that honour would thee do
Were all thy children kinde and naturall
But see thy fault France hath in thee found out
A nest of hollow bosomes which he filles
With treacherous Crownes and three corrupted men
One Richard Earle of Cambridge and the second
Henry Lord Scroope of Masham and the third
Sir Thomas Grey Knight of Northumberland
Haue for the Gilt of France O guilt indeed
Confirmd Conspiracy with fearefull France
And by their hands this grace of Kings must dye
If Hell and Treason hold their promises
Ere he take ship for France and in Southampton
Linger your patience on and weel digest
Th abuse of distance force a play
The summe is payde the Traitors are agreed
The King is set from London and the Scene
Is now transported Gentles to Southampton
There is the Playhouse now there must you sit
And thence to France shall we conuey you safe
And bring you backe Charming the narrow seas
To giue you gentle Passe for if we may
Weel not offend one stomacke with our Play
But till the King come forth and not till then
Vnto Southampton do we shift our Scene

By your owne counsaile is supprest and killd
You must not dare for shame to talke of mercy
For your owne reasons turne into your bosomes
As dogs vpon their maisters worrying you
See you my Princes and my Noble Peeres
These English monsters My Lord of Cambridge heere
You know how apt our loue was to accord
To furnish with all appertinents
Belonging to his Honour and this man
Hath for a few light Crownes lightly conspird
And sworne vnto the practises of France
To kill vs heere in Hampton To the which
This Knight no lesse for bounty bound to Vs
Then Cambridge is hath likewise sworne But O
What shall I say to thee Lord Scroope thou cruell
Ingratefull sauage and inhumane Creature
Thou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes
That knewst the very bottome of my soule
That almost mightst haue coynd me into Golde
Wouldst thou haue practisd on me for thy vse
May it be possible that forraigne hyer
Could out of thee extract one sparke of euill
That might annoy my finger Tis so strange
That though the truth of it stands off as grosse
As black and white my eye will scarsely see it
Treason and murther euer kept together
As two yoake diuels sworne to eythers purpose
Working so grossely in an naturall cause
That admiration did not hoope at them
But thou gainst all proportion didst bring in
Wonder to waite on treason and on murther
And whatsoeuer cunning fiend it was
That wrought vpon thee so preposterously
Hath got the voyce in hell for excellence
And other diuels that suggest by treasons
Do botch and bungle vp damnation
With patches colours and with formes being fetcht
From glistring semblances of piety
But he that temperd thee bad thee stand vp
Gaue thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
Vnlesse to dub thee with the name of Traitor
If that same Daemon that hath gulld thee thus
Should with his Lyongate walke the whole world
He might returne to vastie Tartar backe
And tell the Legions I can neuer win
A soule so easie as that Englishmans
Oh how hast thou with iealousie infected
The sweetnesse of affiance Shew men dutifull
Why so didst thou seeme they graue and learned
Why so didst thou Come they of Noble Family
Why so didst thou Seeme they religious
Why so didst thou Or are they spare in diet
Free from grosse passion or of mirth or anger
Constant in spirit not sweruing with the blood
Garnishd and deckd in modest complement
Not working with the eye without the eare
And but in purged iudgement trusting neither
Such and so finely boulted didst thou seeme
And thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot
To make thee full fraught man and best indued
With some suspition I will weepe for thee
For this reuolt of thine me thinkes is like
Another fall of Man Their faults are open
Arrest them to the answer of the Law
And God acquit them of their practises

   Exe I arrest thee of High Treason by the name of
Richard Earle of Cambridge
I arrest thee of High Treason by the name of Thomas
Lord Scroope of Marsham
I arrest thee of High Treason by the name of Thomas
Grey Knight of Northumberland

   Scro Our purposes God iustly hath discouerd
And I repent my fault more then my death
Which I beseech your Highnesse to forgiue
Although my body pay the price of it

   Cam For me the Gold of France did not seduce
Although I did admit it as a motiue
The sooner to effect what I intended
But God be thanked for preuention
Which in sufferance heartily will reioyce
Beseeching God and you to pardon mee

   Gray Neuer did faithfull subiect more reioyce
At the discouery of most dangerous Treason
Then I do at this houre ioy ore my selfe
Preuented from a damned enterprize
My fault but not my body pardon Soueraigne

   King God quit you in his mercy Hear your sentence
You haue conspird against Our Royall person
Ioynd with an enemy proclaimd and from his Coffers
Receyud the Golden Earnest of Our death
Wherein you would haue sold your King to slaughter
His Princes and his Peeres to seruitude
His Subiects to oppression and contempt
And his whole Kingdome into desolation
Touching our person seeke we no reuenge
But we our Kingdomes safety must so tender
Whose ruine you sought that to her Lawes
We do deliuer you Get you therefore hence
Poore miserable wretches to your death
The taste whereof God of his mercy giue
You patience to indure and true Repentance
Of all your deare offences Beare them hence
Enter

Now Lords for France the enterprise whereof
Shall be to you as vs like glorious
We doubt not of a faire and luckie Warre
Since God so graciously hath brought to light
This dangerous Treason lurking in our way
To hinder our beginnings We doubt not now
But euery Rubbe is smoothed on our way
Then forth deare Countreymen Let vs deliuer
Our Puissance into the hand of God
Putting it straight in expedition
Chearely to Sea the signes of Warre aduance

Enter the French King the Dolphin the Dukes of Berry and
Britaine

  King Thus comes the English with full power vpon vs
And more then carefully it vs concernes
To answer Royally in our defences
Therefore the Dukes of Berry and of Britaine
Of Brabant and of Orleance shall make forth
And you Prince Dolphin with all swift dispatch
To lyne and new repayre our Townes of Warre
With men of courage and with meanes defendant
For England his approaches makes as fierce
As Waters to the sucking of a Gulfe
It fits vs then to be as prouident
As feare may teach vs out of late examples
Left by the fatall and neglected English
Vpon our fields

   Dolphin My most redoubted Father
It is most meet we arme vs gainst the Foe
For Peace it selfe should not so dull a Kingdome
Though War nor no knowne Quarrel were in question
But that Defences Musters Preparations
Should be maintaind assembled and collected
As were a Warre in expectation
Therefore I say tis meet we all goe forth
To view the sick and feeble parts of France
And let vs doe it with no shew of feare
No with no more then if we heard that England
Were busied with a Whitson Morrisdance
For my good Liege shee is so idly Kingd
Her Scepter so phantastically borne
By a vaine giddie shallow humorous Youth
That feare attends her not

   Const O peace Prince Dolphin
You are too much mistaken in this King
Question your Grace the late Embassadors
With what great State he heard their Embassie
How well supplyd with Noble Councellors
How modest in exception and withall
How terrible in constant resolution
And you shall find his Vanities forespent
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus
Couering Discretion with a Coat of Folly
As Gardeners doe with Ordure hide those Roots
That shall first spring and be most delicate

   Dolphin Well tis not so my Lord High Constable
But though we thinke it so it is no matter
In cases of defence tis best to weigh
The Enemie more mightie then he seemes
So the proportions of defence are filld
Which of a weake and niggardly proiection
Doth like a Miser spoyle his Coat with scanting
A little Cloth

   King Thinke we King Harry strong
And Princes looke you strongly arme to meet him
The Kindred of him hath beene flesht vpon vs
And he is bred out of that bloodie straine
That haunted vs in our familiar Pathes
Witnesse our too much memorable shame
When Cressy Battell fatally was strucke
And all our Princes captiud by the hand
Of that black Name Edward black Prince of Wales
Whiles that his Mountaine Sire on Mountaine standing
Vp in the Ayre crownd with the Golden Sunne
Saw his Heroicall Seed and smild to see him
Mangle the Worke of Nature and deface
The Patternes that by God and by French Fathers
Had twentie yeeres been made This is a Stem
Of that Victorious Stock and let vs feare
The Natiue mightinesse and fate of him

That you deuest your selfe and lay apart
The borrowed Glories that by gift of Heauen
By Law of Nature and of Nations longs
To him and to his Heires namely the Crowne
And all widestretched Honors that pertaine
By Custome and the Ordinance of Times
Vnto the Crowne of France that you may know
Tis no sinister nor no awkward Clayme
Pickt from the wormeholes of longvanisht dayes
Nor from the dust of old Obliuion rakt
He sends you this most memorable Lyne
In euery Branch truly demonstratiue
Willing you ouerlooke this Pedigree
And when you find him euenly deriud
From his most famd of famous Ancestors
Edward the third he bids you then resigne
Your Crowne and Kingdome indirectly held
From him the Natiue and true Challenger

   King Or else what followes
  Exe Bloody constraint for if you hide the Crowne
Euen in your hearts there will he rake for it
Therefore in fierce Tempest is he comming
In Thunder and in Earthquake like a Ioue
That if requiring faile he will compell
And bids you in the Bowels of the Lord
Deliuer vp the Crowne and to take mercie
On the poore Soules for whom this hungry Warre
Opens his vastie Iawes and on your head
Turning the Widdowes Teares the Orphans Cryes
The deadmens Blood the priuy Maidens Groanes
For Husbands Fathers and betrothed Louers

Shall chide your Trespas and returne your Mock
In second Accent of his Ordinance

   Dolph Say if my Father render faire returne
It is against my will for I desire
Nothing but Oddes with England
To that end as matching to his Youth and Vanitie
I did present him with the ParisBalls

   Exe Heele make your Paris Louer shake for it
Were it the Mistresse Court of mightie Europe
And be assurd youle find a diffrence
As we his Subiects haue in wonder found
Betweene the promise of his greener dayes

Hold hard the Breath and bend vp euery Spirit
To his full height On on you Noblish English

In libertie of bloody hand shall raunge
With Conscience wide as Hell mowing like Grasse
Your fresh faire Virgins and your flowring Infants
What is it then to me if impious Warre
Arrayed in flames like to the Prince of Fiends
Doe with his smyrcht complexion all fell feats
Enlynckt to wast and desolation
What ist to me when you your selues are cause
If your pure Maydens fall into the hand
Of hot and forcing Violation

When downe the Hill he holds his fierce Carriere
We may as bootlesse spend our vaine Command
Vpon th enraged Souldiers in their spoyle
As send Precepts to the Leuiathan to come ashore

Take pitty of your Towne and of your People

Whiles yet the coole and temperate Wind of Grace
Oreblowes the filthy and contagious Clouds
Of heady Murther Spoyle and Villany

The blind and bloody Souldier with foule hand
Desire the Locks of your shrillshriking Daughters
Your Fathers taken by the siluer Beards
And their most reuerend Heads dasht to the Walls

Whiles the mad Mothers with their howles confusd

  Gower How now Captaine Fluellen come you from
the Bridge
  Flu I assure you there is very excellent Seruices committed
at the Bridge

   Gower Is the Duke of Exeter safe
  Flu The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon
and a man that I loue and honour with my soule
and my heart and my dutie and my liue and my liuing
and my vttermost power He is not God be praysed and
blessed any hurt in the World but keepes the Bridge
most valiantly with excellent discipline There is an aunchient
Lieutenant there at the Pridge I thinke in my very
conscience hee is as valiant a man as Marke Anthony and
hee is a man of no estimation in the World but I did see
him doe as gallant seruice

   Gower What doe you call him
  Flu Hee is calld aunchient Pistoll

   Gower I know him not
Enter Pistoll

  Flu Here is the man

   Pist Captaine I thee beseech to doe me fauours the
Duke of Exeter doth loue thee well

   Flu I I prayse God and I haue merited some loue at
his hands

   Pist Bardolph a Souldier firme and sound of heart
and of buxome valour hath by cruell Fate and giddie
Fortunes furious fickle Wheele that Goddesse blind that
stands vpon the rolling restlesse Stone

   Flu By your patience aunchient Pistoll Fortune is
painted blinde with a Muffler afore his eyes to signifie
to you that Fortune is blinde and shee is painted also
with a Wheele to signifie to you which is the Morall of
it that shee is turning and inconstant and mutabilitie
and variation and her foot looke you is fixed vpon a
Sphericall Stone which rowles and rowles and rowles
in good truth the Poet makes a most excellent description
of it Fortune is an excellent Morall

   Pist Fortune is Bardolphs foe and frownes on him
for he hath stolne a Pax and hanged must a be a damned
death let Gallowes gape for Dogge let Man goe free
and let not Hempe his Windpipe suffocate but Exeter
hath giuen the doome of death for Pax of little price
Therefore goe speake the Duke will heare thy voyce
and let not Bardolphs vitall thred bee cut with edge of
PennyCord and vile reproach Speake Captaine for
his Life and I will thee requite

   Flu Aunchient Pistoll I doe partly vnderstand your
meaning

   Pist Why then reioyce therefore

   Flu Certainly Aunchient it is not a thing to reioyce
at for if looke you he were my Brother I would desire
the Duke to vse his good pleasure and put him to execution
for discipline ought to be vsed

   Pist Dye and be damd and Figo for thy friendship

Pridge as you shall see in a Summers day but it is very
well what he has spoke to me that is well I warrant you
when time is serue

   Gower Why tis a Gull a Foole a Rogue that now and
then goes to the Warres to grace himselfe at his returne
into London vnder the forme of a Souldier and such
fellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders Names and
they will learne you by rote where Seruices were done
at such and such a Sconce at such a Breach at such a Conuoy
who came off brauely who was shot who disgracd
what termes the Enemy stood on and this they
conne perfitly in the phrase of Warre which they tricke
vp with newtuned Oathes and what a Beard of the Generalls
Cut and a horride Sute of the Campe will doe among
foming Bottles and Alewasht Wits is wonderfull
to be thought on but you must learne to know such
slanders of the age or else you may be maruellously mistooke

   Flu I tell you what Captaine Gower I doe perceiue
hee is not the man that hee would gladly make shew to
the World hee is if I finde a hole in his Coat I will tell
him my minde hearke you the King is comming and I
must speake with him from the Pridge

Drum and Colours Enter the King and his poore Souldiers

the Countrey there be nothing compelld from the Villages

of his ransome which must proportion the losses we
haue borne the subiects we haue lost the disgrace we
haue digested which in weight to reanswer his pettinesse
would bow vnder For our losses his Exchequer is
too poore for th effusion of our bloud the Muster of his
Kingdome too faint a number and for our disgrace his
owne person kneeling at our feet but a weake and worthlesse
satisfaction To this adde defiance and tell him for
conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation

   King Thou doost thy Office fairely Turne thee backe
And tell thy King I doe not seeke him now
But could be willing to march on to Callice
Without impeachment for to say the sooth
Though tis no wisdome to confesse so much
Vnto an enemie of Craft and Vantage
My people are with sicknesse much enfeebled
My numbers lessend and those few I haue
Almost no better then so many French
Who when they were in health I tell thee Herald
I thought vpon one payre of English Legges
Did march three Frenchmen Yet forgiue me God
That I doe bragge thus this your ayre of France
Hath blowne that vice in me I must repent
Goe therefore tell thy Master heere I am
My Ransome is this frayle and worthlesse Trunke
My Army but a weake and sickly Guard
Yet God before tell him we will come on
Though France himselfe and such another Neighbor
Stand in our way Theres for thy labour Mountioy
Goe bid thy Master well aduise himselfe
If we may passe we will if we be hindred
We shall your tawnie ground with your red blood
Discolour and so Mountioy fare you well
The summe of all our Answer is but this
We would not seeke a Battaile as we are
Nor as we are we say we will not shun it
So tell your Master

   Mount I shall deliuer so Thankes to your Highnesse

   Glouc I hope they will not come vpon vs now

   King We are in Gods hand Brother not in theirs
March to the Bridge it now drawes toward night
Beyond the Riuer weele encampe our selues
And on to morrow bid them march away

Actus Tertius

Chorus

Now entertaine coniecture of a time
When creeping Murmure and the poring Darke
Fills the wide Vessell of the Vniuerse
From Camp to Camp through the foule Womb of Night
The Humme of eyther Army stilly sounds
That the fixt Centinels almost receiue
The secret Whispers of each others Watch
Fire answers fire and through their paly flames
Each Battaile sees the others vmberd face
Steed threatens Steed in high and boastfull Neighs
Piercing the Nights dull Eare and from the Tents
The Armourers accomplishing the Knights
With busie Hammers closing Riuets vp
Giue dreadfull note of preparation
The Countrey Cocks doe crow the Clocks doe towle
And the third howre of drowsie Morning namd
Prowd of their Numbers and secure in Soule
The confident and ouerlustie French
Doe the lowrated English play at Dice
And chide the creepletardygated Night
Who like a foule and ougly Witch doth limpe
So tediously away The poore condemned English
Like Sacrifices by their watchfull Fires
Sit patiently and inly ruminate
The Mornings danger and their gesture sad
Inuesting lankeleane Cheekes and Warreworne Coats
Presented them vnto the gazing Moone
So many horride Ghosts O now who will behold
The Royall Captaine of this ruind Band
Walking from Watch to Watch from Tent to Tent
Let him cry Prayse and Glory on his head
For forth he goes and visits all his Hoast
Bids them good morrow with a modest Smyle
And calls them Brothers Friends and Countreymen
Vpon his Royall Face there is no note
How dread an Army hath enrounded him
Nor doth he dedicate one iot of Colour
Vnto the wearie and allwatched Night
But freshly lookes and ouerbeares Attaint
With chearefull semblance and sweet Maiestie
That euery Wretch pining and pale before
Beholding him plucks comfort from his Lookes
A Largesse vniuersall like the Sunne
His liberall Eye doth giue to euery one
Thawing cold feare that meane and gentle all
Behold as may vnworthinesse define
A little touch of Harry in the Night
And so our Scene must to the Battaile flye
Where O for pitty we shall much disgrace
With foure or fiue most vile and ragged foyles
Right ill disposd in brawle ridiculous
The Name of Agincourt Yet sit and see
Minding true things by what their Mockries bee
Enter

Enter the King Bedford and Gloucester

  King Gloster tis true that we are in great danger
The greater therefore should our Courage be
God morrow Brother Bedford God Almightie
There is some soule of goodnesse in things euill
Would men obseruingly distill it out
For our bad Neighbour makes vs early stirrers
Which is both healthfull and good husbandry
Besides they are our outward Consciences
And Preachers to vs all admonishing
That we should dresse vs fairely for our end
Thus may we gather Honey from the Weed
And make a Morall of the Diuell himselfe
Enter Erpingham

Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham
A good soft Pillow for that good white Head
Were better then a churlish turfe of France

   Erping Not so my Liege this Lodging likes me better
Since I may say now lye I like a King

   King Tis good for men to loue their present paines
Vpon example so the Spirit is eased
And when the Mind is quickned out of doubt
The Organs though defunct and dead before
Breake vp their drowsie Graue and newly moue
With casted slough and fresh legeritie
Lend me thy Cloake Sir Thomas Brothers both
Commend me to the Princes in our Campe
Doe my good morrow to them and anon
Desire them all to my Pauillion

   Gloster We shall my Liege

   Erping Shall I attend your Grace
  King No my good Knight
Goe with my Brothers to my Lords of England

Enter Fluellen and Gower

  Gower Captaine Fluellen

   Flu So in the Name of Iesu Christ speake fewer it
is the greatest admiration in the vniuersall World when
the true and aunchient Prerogatifes and Lawes of the
Warres is not kept if you would take the paines but to
examine the Warres of Pompey the Great you shall finde
I warrant you that there is no tiddle tadle nor pibble bable
in Pompeyes Campe I warrant you you shall finde
the Ceremonies of the Warres and the Cares of it and
the Formes of it and the Sobrietie of it and the Modestie
of it to be otherwise

   Gower Why the Enemie is lowd you heare him all
Night

   Flu If the Enemie is an Asse and a Foole and a prating
Coxcombe is it meet thinke you that wee should
also looke you be an Asse and a Foole and a prating Coxcombe
in your owne conscience now
  Gow I will speake lower

   Flu I pray you and beseech you that you will
Enter

  King Though it appeare a little out of fashion
There is much care and valour in this Welchman
Enter three Souldiers Iohn Bates Alexander Court and Michael
Williams


  Court Brother Iohn Bates is not that the Morning
which breakes yonder
  Bates I thinke it be but wee haue no great cause to
desire the approach of day

   Williams Wee see yonder the beginning of the day
but I thinke wee shall neuer see the end of it Who goes
there
  King A Friend

   Williams Vnder what Captaine serue you
  King Vnder Sir Iohn Erpingham

   Williams A good old Commander and a most kinde
Gentleman I pray you what thinkes he of our estate
  King Euen as men wrackt vpon a Sand that looke to
be washt off the next Tyde

   Bates He hath not told his thought to the King
  King No nor it is not meet he should for though I
speake it to you I thinke the King is but a man as I am
the Violet smells to him as it doth to me the Element
shewes to him as it doth to me all his Sences haue but
humane Conditions his Ceremonies layd by in his Nakednesse
he appeares but a man and though his affections
are higher mounted then ours yet when they stoupe
they stoupe with the like wing therefore when he sees
reason of feares as we doe his feares out of doubt be of
the same rellish as ours are yet in reason no man should
possesse him with any appearance of feare least hee by
shewing it should dishearten his Army

   Bates He may shew what outward courage he will
but I beleeue as cold a Night as tis hee could wish himselfe
in Thames vp to the Neck and so I would he were
and I by him at all aduentures so we were quit here

   King By my troth I will speake my conscience of the
King I thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where
but where hee is

   Bates Then I would he were here alone so should he be
sure to be ransomed and a many poore mens liues saued

   King I dare say you loue him not so ill to wish him
here alone howsoeuer you speake this to feele other
mens minds me thinks I could not dye any where so contented
as in the Kings company his Cause being iust and
his Quarrell honorable

   Williams Thats more then we know

   Bates I or more then wee should seeke after for wee
know enough if wee know wee are the Kings Subiects
if his Cause be wrong our obedience to the King wipes
the Cryme of it out of vs

   Williams But if the Cause be not good the King himselfe
hath a heauie Reckoning to make when all those
Legges and Armes and Heads chopt off in a Battaile
shall ioyne together at the latter day and cry all Wee dyed
at such a place some swearing some crying for a Surgean
some vpon their Wiues left poore behind them
some vpon the Debts they owe some vpon their Children
rawly left I am afeard there are few dye well that dye
in a Battaile for how can they charitably dispose of any
thing when Blood is their argument Now if these men
doe not dye well it will be a black matter for the King
that led them to it who to disobey were against all proportion
of subiection

   King So if a Sonne that is by his Father sent about
Merchandize doe sinfully miscarry vpon the Sea the imputation
of his wickednesse by your rule should be imposed
vpon his Father that sent him or if a Seruant vnder
his Masters command transporting a summe of Money
be assayled by Robbers and dye in many irreconcild
Iniquities you may call the businesse of the Master the
author of the Seruants damnation but this is not so
The King is not bound to answer the particular endings
of his Souldiers the Father of his Sonne nor the Master
of his Seruant for they purpose not their death when
they purpose their seruices Besides there is no King be
his Cause neuer so spotlesse if it come to the arbitrement
of Swords can trye it out with all vnspotted Souldiers
some peraduenture haue on them the guilt of
premeditated and contriued Murther some of beguiling
Virgins with the broken Seales of Periurie some
making the Warres their Bulwarke that haue before gored
the gentle Bosome of Peace with Pillage and Robberie
Now if these men haue defeated the Law and outrunne
Natiue punishment though they can outstrip
men they haue no wings to flye from God Warre is
his Beadle Warre is his Vengeance so that here men
are punisht for before breach of the Kings Lawes in
now the Kings Quarrell where they feared the death
they haue borne life away and where they would bee
safe they perish Then if they dye vnprouided no more
is the King guiltie of their damnation then hee was before
guiltie of those Impieties for the which they are
now visited Euery Subiects Dutie is the Kings but
euery Subiects Soule is his owne Therefore should
euery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery sicke man in
his Bed wash euery Moth out of his Conscience and
dying so Death is to him aduantage or not dying
the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was
gayned and in him that escapes it were not sinne to
thinke that making God so free an offer he let him outliue
that day to see his Greatnesse and to teach others
how they should prepare

   Will Tis certaine euery man that dyes ill the ill vpon
his owne head the King is not to answer it

   Bates I doe not desire hee should answer for me and
yet I determine to fight lustily for him

   King I my selfe heard the King say he would not be
ransomd

   Will I hee said so to make vs fight chearefully but
when our throats are cut hee may be ransomd and wee
nere the wiser

   King If I liue to see it I will neuer trust his word after

   Will You pay him then thats a perillous shot out
of an Elder Gunne that a poore and a priuate displeasure
can doe against a Monarch you may as well goe about
to turne the Sunne to yce with fanning in his face with a
Peacocks feather Youle neuer trust his word after
come tis a foolish saying

   King Your reproofe is something too round I should
be angry with you if the time were conuenient

   Will Let it bee a Quarrell betweene vs if you
liue

   King I embrace it

   Will How shall I know thee againe
  King Giue me any Gage of thine and I will weare it
in my Bonnet Then if euer thou darst acknowledge it
I will make it my Quarrell

   Will Heeres my Gloue Giue mee another of
thine

   King There

   Will This will I also weare in my Cap if euer thou
come to me and say after to morrow This is my Gloue
by this Hand I will take thee a box on the eare

   King If euer I liue to see it I will challenge it

   Will Thou darst as well be hangd

   King Well I will doe it though I take thee in the
Kings companie

   Will Keepe thy word fare thee well

   Bates Be friends you English fooles be friends wee
haue French Quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon

Exit Souldiers

  King Indeede the French may lay twentie French
Crownes to one they will beat vs for they beare them
on their shoulders but it is no English Treason to cut
French Crownes and to morrow the King himselfe will
be a Clipper
Vpon the King let vs our Liues our Soules
Our Debts our carefull Wiues
Our Children and our Sinnes lay on the King
We must beare all
O hard Condition Twinborne with Greatnesse
Subiect to the breath of euery foole whose sence
No more can feele but his owne wringing
What infinite heartsease must Kings neglect
That priuate men enioy
And what haue Kings that Priuates haue not too
Saue Ceremonie saue generall Ceremonie
And what art thou thou Idoll Ceremonie
What kind of God art thou that sufferst more
Of mortall griefes then doe thy worshippers
What are thy Rents what are thy Commings in
O Ceremonie shew me but thy worth
What is thy Soule of Odoration
Art thou ought else but Place Degree and Forme
Creating awe and feare in other men
Wherein thou art lesse happy being feard
Then they in fearing
What drinkst thou oft in stead of Homage sweet
But poysond flatterie O be sick great Greatnesse
And bid thy Ceremonie giue thee cure
Thinks thou the fierie Feuer will goe out
With Titles blowne from Adulation
Will it giue place to flexure and low bending
Canst thou when thou commandst the beggers knee
Command the health of it No thou prowd Dreame
That playst so subtilly with a Kings Repose
I am a King that find thee and I know
Tis not the Balme the Scepter and the Ball
The Sword the Mase the Crowne Imperiall
The entertissued Robe of Gold and Pearle
The farsed Title running fore the King
The Throne he sits on nor the Tyde of Pompe
That beates vpon the high shore of this World
No not all these thricegorgeous Ceremonie
Not all these layd in Bed Maiesticall
Can sleepe so soundly as the wretched Slaue
Who with a body filld and vacant mind
Gets him to rest cramd with distressefull bread
Neuer sees horride Night the Child of Hell
But like a Lacquey from the Rise to Set
Sweates in the eye of Phebus and all Night
Sleepes in Elizium next day after dawne
Doth rise and helpe Hiperion to his Horse
And followes so the euerrunning yeere
With profitable labour to his Graue
And but for Ceremonie such a Wretch
Winding vp Dayes with toyle and Nights with sleepe

Will yeerely on the Vigil feast his neighbours

For he to day that sheds his blood with me

Pales in the flood with Men Wiues and Boyes
Whose shouts  claps outvoyce the deepmouthd Sea
Which like a mightie Whiffler fore the King
Seemes to prepare his way So let him land
And solemnly see him set on to London
So swift a pace hath Thought that euen now
You may imagine him vpon BlackHeath
Where that his Lords desire him to haue borne
His bruised Helmet and his bended Sword
Before him through the Citie he forbids it
Being free from vainnesse and selfeglorious pride
Giuing full Trophee Signall and Ostent
Quite from himselfe to God But now behold
In the quick Forge and workinghouse of Thought

As in good time he may from Ireland comming
Bringing Rebellion broached on his Sword
How many would the peacefull Citie quit
To welcome him much more and much more cause
Did they this Harry Now in London place him

Inuites the King of Englands stay at home

Corrupting in it owne fertilitie
Her Vine the merry chearer of the heart
Vnpruned dyes her Hedges euen pleachd

Put forth disorderd Twigs her fallow Leas
The Darnell Hemlock and ranke Femetary
Doth root vpon while that the Culter rusts

The euen Meade that erst brought sweetly forth
The freckled Cowslip Burnet and greene Clouer
Wanting the Sythe withall vncorrected ranke
Conceiues by idlenesse and nothing teemes
But hatefull Docks rough Thistles Keksyes Burres
Loosing both beautie and vtilitie
And all our Vineyards Fallowes Meades and Hedges
Defectiue in their natures grow to wildnesse
Euen so our Houses and our selues and Children
Haue lost or doe not learne for want of time
The Sciences that should become our Countrey

   King Faire Katherine and most faire
Will you vouchsafe to teach a Souldier tearmes
Such as will enter at a Ladyes eare
And pleade his Louesuit to her gentle heart

   Kath Your Maiestie shall mock at me I cannot speake
your England

   King O faire Katherine if you will loue me soundly
with your French heart I will be glad to heare you confesse
it brokenly with your English Tongue Doe you
like me Kate
  Kath Pardonne moy I cannot tell wat is like me

   King An Angell is like you Kate and you are like an
Angell

   Kath Que dit il que Ie suis semblable a les Anges
  Lady Ouy verayment sauf vostre Grace ainsi dit il

   King I said so deare Katherine and I must not blush
to affirme it

   Kath O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont plein de
tromperies

   King What sayes she faire one that the tongues of
men are full of deceits
  Lady Ouy dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits
dat is de Princesse

   King The Princesse is the better Englishwoman
yfaith Kate my wooing is fit for thy vnderstanding I am
glad thou canst speake no better English for if thou
couldst thou wouldst finde me such a plaine King that
thou wouldst thinke I had sold my Farme to buy my
Crowne I know no wayes to mince it in loue but directly
to say I loue you then if you vrge me farther
then to say Doe you in faith I weare out my suite Giue
me your answer yfaith doe and so clap hands and a bargaine
how say you Lady
  Kath Sauf vostre honeur me vnderstand well

   King Marry if you would put me to Verses or to
Dance for your sake Kate why you vndid me for the one
I haue neither words nor measure and for the other I
haue no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in
strength If I could winne a Lady at Leapefrogge or by
vawting into my Saddle with my Armour on my backe
vnder the correction of bragging be it spoken I should
quickly leape into a Wife Or if I might buffet for my
Loue or bound my Horse for her fauours I could lay on
like a Butcher and sit like a Iack an Apes neuer off But
before God Kate I cannot looke greenely nor gaspe out
my eloquence nor I haue no cunning in protestation
onely downeright Oathes which I neuer vse till vrgd
nor neuer breake for vrging If thou canst loue a fellow
of this temper Kate whose face is not worth Sunneburning
that neuer lookes in his Glasse for loue of any
thing he sees there let thine Eye be thy Cooke I speake
to thee plaine Souldier If thou canst loue me for this
take me if not to say to thee that I shall dye is true but
for thy loue by the Lord No yet I loue thee too And
while thou liust deare Kate take a fellow of plaine and
vncoyned Constancie for he perforce must do thee right
because he hath not the gift to wooe in other places for
these fellowes of infinit tongue that can ryme themselues
into Ladyes fauours they doe alwayes reason themselues
out againe What a speaker is but a prater a Ryme is
but a Ballad a good Legge will fall a strait Backe will
stoope a blacke Beard will turne white a curld Pate will
grow bald a faire Face will wither a full Eye will wax
hollow but a good Heart Kate is the Sunne and the
Moone or rather the Sunne and not the Moone for it
shines bright and neuer changes but keepes his course
truly If thou would haue such a one take me and
take me take a Souldier take a Souldier take a King
And what sayst thou then to my Loue speake my faire
and fairely I pray thee

   Kath Is it possible dat I sould loue de ennemie of
Fraunce
  King No it is not possible you should loue the Enemie
of France Kate but in louing me you should loue
the Friend of France for I loue France so well that I
will not part with a Village of it I will haue it all mine
and Kate when France is mine and I am yours then yours
is France and you are mine

   Kath I cannot tell wat is dat

   King No Kate I will tell thee in French which I am
sure will hang vpon my tongue like a newmarried Wife
about her Husbands Necke hardly to be shooke off Ie
quand sur le possession de Fraunce  quand vous aues le
possession

my speede Donc vostre est Fraunce  vous estes mienne
It is as easie for me Kate to conquer the Kingdome as to
speake so much more French I shall neuer moue thee in
French vnlesse it be to laugh at me

   Kath Sauf vostre honeur le Francois ques vous parleis il
 melieus que l Anglois le quel Ie parle

   King No faith ist not Kate but thy speaking of
my Tongue and I thine most truely falsely must
needes be graunted to be much at one But Kate doost
thou vnderstand thus much English Canst thou loue
mee
  Kath I cannot tell

   King Can any of your Neighbours tell Kate Ile
aske them Come I know thou louest me and at night
when you come into your Closet youle question this
Gentlewoman about me and I know Kate you will to
her disprayse those parts in me that you loue with your
heart but good Kate mocke me mercifully the rather
gentle Princesse because I loue thee cruelly If euer thou
beest mine Kate as I haue a sauing Faith within me tells
me thou shalt I get thee with skambling and thou
must therefore needes proue a good Souldierbreeder
Shall not thou and I betweene Saint Dennis and Saint
George compound a Boy halfe French halfe English
that shall goe to Constantinople and take the Turke by
the Beard Shall wee not what sayst thou my faire
FlowerdeLuce

Thus farre with rough and allvnable Pen
Our bending Author hath pursud the Story
In little roome confining mightie men
Mangling by starts the full course of their glory
Small time but in that small most greatly liued
This Starre of England Fortune made his Sword
By which the Worlds best Garden he atchieued
And of it left his Sonne Imperiall Lord
Henry the Sixt in Infant Bands crownd King
Of France and England did this King succeed
Whose State so many had the managing
That they lost France and made his England bleed
Which oft our Stage hath showne and for their sake
In your faire minds let this acceptance take

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included  Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work  The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001  10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Executive Directors Notes

In addition to the notes below and so you will NOT think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected here are the first few lines of Hamlet as they
are presented herein

  Barnardo Whos there
  Fran Nay answer me Stand  vnfold
your selfe

   Bar Long liue the King



As I understand it the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner   

The answer is that they MAY have packed liue into a cliche at a
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in
place of some ws etc  This was a common practice of the day
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to

You will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as I
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a
very high place in the canon of Shakespeare  My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous
for signing his name with several different spellings

So please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file  you may see errors
that are not errors   

So  with this caveat  we have NOT changed the canon errors
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeares The Tragedie
of Othello the Moore of Venice

Scanners Notes What this is and isnt  This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeares first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text

The elongated Ss have been changed to small ss and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae  I have left the spelling
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text  I have corrected some spelling mistakes I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeares First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template typos and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them  Everything within
brackets  is what I have added  So if you dont like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare

Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio  So there may
be differences other than what I have mentioned above between
this and other first folio editions  This is due to the printers
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run  The proof run wasnt thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies  This is just the way it is
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions best pages

If you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors  I wish to make this the best
etext possible  My email address for right now are haraddaaolcom
and davidrinconnectcom  I hope that you enjoy this

Enter Rodorigo and Iago

  Rodorigo Neuer tell me I take it much vnkindly
That thou Iago who hast had my purse
As if y strings were thine shouldst know of this

   Ia But youl not heare me If euer I did dream
Of such a matter abhorre me

   Rodo Thou toldst me
Thou didst hold him in thy hate

   Iago Despise me
If I do not Three Greatones of the Cittie
In personall suite to make me his Lieutenant
Offcapt to him and by the faith of man
I know my price I am worth no worsse a place
But he as louing his owne pride and purposes
Euades them with a bumbast Circumstance
Horribly stufft with Epithites of warre
Nonsuites my Mediators For certes saies he
I haue already chose my Officer And what was he
Forsooth a great Arithmatician
One Michaell Cassio a Florentine
A Fellow almost damnd in a faire Wife
That neuer set a Squadron in the Field
Nor the deuision of a Battaile knowes
More then a Spinster Vnlesse the Bookish Theoricke
Wherein the Tongued Consuls can propose
As Masterly as he Meere pratle without practise
Is all his Souldiership But he Sir had th election
And I of whom his eies had seene the proofe
At Rhodes at Ciprus and on others grounds
Christend and Heathen must be beleed and calmd
By Debitor and Creditor This Countercaster
He in good time must his Lieutenant be
And I blesse the marke his Mooreships Auntient

   Rod By heauen I rather would haue bin his hangman

   Iago Why theres no remedie
Tis the cursse of Seruice
Preferment goes by Letter and affection
And not by old gradation where each second
Stood Heire toth first Now Sir be iudge your selfe
Whether I in any iust terme am Affind
To loue the Moore
  Rod I would not follow him then

   Iago O Sir content you
I follow him to serue my turne vpon him
We cannot all be Masters nor all Masters
Cannot be truely followd You shall marke
Many a dutious and kneecrooking knaue
That doting on his owne obsequious bondage
Weares out his time much like his Masters Asse
For naught but Prouender  when hes old Casheerd
Whip me such honest knaues Others there are
Who trymd in Formes and visages of Dutie
Keepe yet their hearts attending on themselues
And throwing but showes of Seruice on their Lords
Doe well thriue by them
And when they haue lind their Coates
Doe themselues Homage
These Fellowes haue some soule
And such a one do I professe my selfe For Sir
It is as sure as you are Rodorigo
Were I the Moore I would not be Iago
In following him I follow but my selfe
Heauen is my Iudge not I for loue and dutie
But seeming so for my peculiar end
For when my outward Action doth demonstrate
The natiue act and figure of my heart
In Complement externe tis not long after
But I will weare my heart vpon my sleeue
For Dawes to pecke at I am not what I am

   Rod What a fall Fortune dos the Thickslips owe
If he can carryt thus
  Iago Call vp her Father
Rowse him make after him poyson his delight
Proclaime him in the Streets Incense her kinsmen
And though he in a fertile Clymate dwell
Plague him with Flies though that his Ioy be Ioy
Yet throw such chances of vexation ont
As it may loose some colour

   Rodo Heere is her Fathers house Ile call aloud

   Iago Doe with like timerous accent and dire yell
As when by Night and Negligence the Fire
Is spied in populus Citties

   Rodo What hoa Brabantio Signior Brabantio hoa

My spirits and my place haue in their power
To make this bitter to thee

   Rodo Most graue Brabantio
In simple and pure soule I come to you

   Ia Sir you are one of those that will not serue God
if the deuill bid you Because we come to do you seruice
and you thinke we are Ruffians youle haue your Daughter
couerd with a Barbary horse youle haue your Nephewes
neigh to you youle haue Coursers for Cozens
and Gennets for Germaines

   Bra What prophane wretch art thou
  Ia I am one Sir that comes to tell you your Daughter
and the Moore are making the Beast with two backs

   Bra Thou art a Villaine

   Iago You are a Senator

   Bra This thou shalt answere I know thee Rodorigo

   Rod Sir I will answere any thing But I beseech you
Ift be your pleasure and most wise consent
As partly I find it is that your faire Daughter
At this odde Euen and dull watch oth night
Transported with no worse nor better guard
But with a knaue of common hire a Gundelier
To the grosse claspes of a Lasciuious Moore
If this be knowne to you and your Allowance
We then haue done you bold and saucie wrongs
But if you know not this my Manners tell me
We haue your wrong rebuke Do not beleeue
That from the sence of all Ciuilitie
I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence
Your Daughter if you haue not giuen her leaue
I say againe hath made a grosse reuolt
Tying her Dutie Beautie Wit and Fortunes
In an extrauagant and wheeling Stranger
Of here and euery where straight satisfie your selfe
If she be in her Chamber or your house
Let loose on me the Iustice of the State
For thus deluding you

This Accident is not vnlike my dreame
Beleefe of it oppresses me alreadie
Light I say light
Enter

  Iag Farewell for I must leaue you
It seemes not meete nor wholesome to my place
To be producted as if I stay I shall
Against the Moore For I do know the State
How euer this may gall him with some checke
Cannot with safetie casthim For hes embarkd
With such loud reason to the Cyprus Warres
Which euen now stands in Act that for their soules
Another of his Fadome they haue none
To lead their Businesse In which regard
Though I do hate him as I do hell paines
Yet for necessitie of present life
I must show out a Flag and signe of Loue
Which is indeed but signe that you shal surely find him
Lead to the Sagitary the raised Search
And there will I be with him So farewell

Enter

Enter Brabantio with Seruants and Torches

  Bra It is too true an euill Gone she is
And whats to come of my despised time
Is naught but bitternesse Now Rodorigo

With the Moore saist thou Who would be a Father
How didst thou know twas she Oh she deceaues me
Past thought what said she to you Get moe Tapers
Raise all my Kindred Are they married thinke you
  Rodo Truely I thinke they are

   Bra Oh Heauen how got she out
Oh treason of the blood
Fathers from hence trust not your Daughters minds
By what you see them act Is there not Charmes
By which the propertie of Youth and Maidhood
May be abusd Haue you not read Rodorigo
Of some such thing
  Rod Yes Sir I haue indeed

   Bra Call vp my Brother oh would you had had her
Some one way some another Doe you know

To do no contriud Murder I lacke Iniquitie
Sometime to do me seruice Nine or ten times
I had thought thaue yerkd him here vnder the Ribbes

   Othello Tis better as it is

   Iago Nay but he prated
And spoke such scuruy and prouoking termes
Against your Honor that with the little godlinesse I haue
I did full hard forbeare him But I pray you Sir
Are you fast married Be assurd of this
That the Magnifico is much beloud
And hath in his effect a voice potentiall
As double as the Dukes He will diuorce you
Or put vpon you what restraint or greeuance
The Law with all his might to enforce it on
Will giue him Cable

   Othel Let him do his spight

Shall outtongue his Complaints Tis yet to know
Which when I know that boasting is an Honour
I shall promulgate I fetch my life and being
From Men of Royall Seige And my demerites
May speake vnbonnetted to as proud a Fortune
As this that I haue reachd For know Iago

  Cassio Something from Cyprus as I may diuine
It is a businesse of some heate The Gallies
Haue sent a dozen sequent Messengers
This very night at one anothers heeles
And many of the Consuls raisd and met
Are at the Dukes already You haue bin hotly calld for
When being not at your Lodging to be found
The Senate hath sent about three seuerall Quests
To search you out

   Othel Tis well I am found by you
I will but spend a word here in the house
And goe with you

   Cassio Aunciant what makes he heere
  Iago Faith he to night hath boarded a Land Carract
If it proue lawfull prize hes made for euer

  Iago Marry to Come Captaine will you go

   Iago You Rodorigo Come Sir I am for you

   Othe Keepe vp your bright Swords for the dew will
rust them Good Signior you shall more command with
yeares then with your Weapons

   Bra Oh thou foule Theefe
Where hast thou stowd my Daughter
Damnd as thou art thou hast enchaunted her
For Ile referre me to all things of sense
If she in Chaines of Magick were not bound
Whether a Maid so tender Faire and Happie
So opposite to Marriage that she shund
The wealthy curled Deareling of our Nation
Would euer haue t encurre a generall mocke
Run from her Guardage to the sootie bosome
Of such a thing as thou to feare not to delight
Iudge me the world if tis not grosse in sense
That thou hast practisd on her with foule Charmes
Abusd her delicate Youth with Drugs or Minerals
That weakens Motion Ile hauet disputed on
Tis probable and palpable to thinking
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the World a practiser
Of Arts inhibited and out of warrant
Lay hold vpon him if he do resist
Subdue him at his perill

   Othe Hold your hands
Both you of my inclining and the rest
Were it my Cue to fight I should haue knowne it
Without a Prompter Whether will you that I goe
To answere this your charge
  Bra To Prison till fit time
Of Law and course of direct Session
Call thee to answer

   Othe What if I do obey
How may the Duke be therewith satisfid
Whose Messengers are heere about my side
Vpon some present businesse of the State
To bring me to him

   Officer Tis true most worthy Signior
The Dukes in Counsell and your Noble selfe
I am sure is sent for

   Bra How The Duke in Counsell
In this time of the night Bring him away
Mines not an idle Cause The Duke himselfe
Or any of my Brothers of the State
Cannot but feele this wrong as twere their owne
For if such Actions may haue passage free
Bondslaues and Pagans shall our Statesmen be

Exeunt

Enter Duke Senators and Officers

  Duke Theres no composition in this Newes
That giues them Credite

   1Sen Indeed they are disproportioned
My Letters say a Hundred and seuen Gallies

   Duke And mine a Hundred fortie

   2Sena And mine two Hundred
But though they iumpe not on a iust accompt
As in these Cases where the ayme reports
Tis oft with difference yet do they all confirme
A Turkish Fleete and bearing vp to Cyprus

   Duke Nay it is possible enough to iudgement
I do not so secure me in the Error
But the maine Article I do approue
In fearefull sense

   Duke Now Whats the businesse
  Sailor The Turkish Preparation makes for Rhodes
So was I bid report here to the State
By Signior Angelo

   Duke How say you by this change
  1Sen This cannot be
By no assay of reason Tis a Pageant
To keepe vs in false gaze when we consider
Th importancie of Cyprus to the Turke
And let our selues againe but vnderstand
That as it more concernes the Turke then Rhodes
So may he with more facile question beare it
For that it stands not in such Warrelike brace
But altogether lackes th abilities
That Rhodes is dressd in If we make thought of this
We must not thinke the Turke is so vnskillfull
To leaue that latest which concernes him first
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gaine
To wake and wage a danger profitlesse

   Duke Nay in all confidence hes not for Rhodes

   Officer Here is more Newes

Enter a Messenger

  Messen The Ottamites Reuerend and Gracious
Steering with due course toward the Ile of Rhodes
Haue there inioynted them with an after Fleete

  Mess Of thirtie Saile and now they do restem
Their backward course bearing with frank appearance
Their purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montano
Your trustie and most Valiant Seruitour
With his free dutie recommends you thus
And prayes you to beleeue him

   Duke Tis certaine then for Cyprus
Marcus Luccicos is not he in Towne

  Duke Valiant Othello we must straight employ you
Against the generall Enemy Ottoman
I did not see you welcome gentle Signior
We lackt your Counsaile and your helpe to night

   Bra So did I yours Good your Grace pardon me
Neither my place nor ought I heard of businesse
Hath raisd me from my bed nor doth the generall care
Take hold on me For my perticular griefe
Is of so floodgate and orebearing Nature
That it engluts and swallowes other sorrowes
And it is still it selfe

   Duke Why Whats the matter
  Bra My Daughter oh my Daughter
  Sen Dead
  Bra I to me
She is abusd stolne from me and corrupted
By Spels and Medicines bought of Mountebanks
For Nature so prepostrously to erre
Being not deficient blind or lame of sense
Sans witchcraft could not

   Duke Who ere he be that in this foule proceeding
Hath thus beguild your Daughter of her selfe
And you of her the bloodie Booke of Law
You shall your selfe read in the bitter letter
After your owne sense yea though our proper Son
Stood in your Action

   Bra Humbly I thanke your Grace
Here is the man this Moore whom now it seemes
Your speciall Mandate for the State affaires
Hath hither brought

   All We are verie sorry fort

   Duke What in your owne part can you say to this
  Bra Nothing but this is so

   Othe Most Potent Graue and Reuerend Signiors
My very Noble and approud good Masters
That I haue tane away this old mans Daughter
It is most true true I haue married her
The verie head and front of my offending
Hath this extent no more Rude am I in my speech
And little blessd with the soft phrase of Peace
For since these Armes of mine had seuen yeares pith
Till now some nine Moones wasted they haue vsd
Their deerest action in the Tented Field
And little of this great world can I speake
More then pertaines to Feats of Broiles and Battaile
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for my selfe Yet by your gratious patience
I will a round vnvarnishd Tale deliuer
Of my whole course of Loue
What Drugges what Charmes
What Coniuration and what mighty Magicke
For such proceeding I am chargd withall
I won his Daughter

   Bra A Maiden neuer bold
Of Spirit so still and quiet that her Motion
Blushd at her selfe and she in spight of Nature
Of Yeares of Country Credite euery thing
To fall in Loue with what she feard to looke on
It is a iudgement maind and most imperfect
That will confesse Perfection so could erre
Against all rules of Nature and must be driuen
To find out practises of cunning hell
Why this should be I therefore vouch againe
That with some Mixtures powrefull ore the blood
Or with some Dram coniurd to this effect
He wrought vpon her
To vouch this is no proofe
Without more wider and more ouer Test
Then these thin habits and poore likelyhoods
Of moderne seeming do prefer against him

   Sen But Othello speake
Did you by indirect and forced courses
Subdue and poyson this yong Maides affections
Or came it by request and such faire question
As soule to soule affordeth
  Othel I do beseech you
Send for the Lady to the Sagitary
And let her speake of me before her Father
If you do finde me foule in her report
The Trust the Office I do hold of you
Not onely take away but let your Sentence
Euen fall vpon my life

   Duke Fetch Desdemona hither

   Othe Aunciant conduct them
You best know the place
And tell she come as truely as to heauen
I do confesse the vices of my blood
So iustly to your Graue eares Ile present
How I did thriue in this faire Ladies loue
And she in mine

   Duke Say it Othello

   Othe Her Father loud me oft inuited me
Still questiond me the Storie of my life
From yeare to yeare the Battaile Sieges Fortune
That I haue past
I ran it through euen from my boyish daies
Toth very moment that he bad me tell it
Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances
Of mouing Accidents by Flood and Field
Of hairebreadth scapes ith imminent deadly breach
Of being taken by the Insolent Foe
And sold to slauery Of my redemption thence
And portance in my Trauellours historie
Wherein of Antars vast and Desarts idle
Rough Quarries Rocks Hills whose head touch heauen
It was my hint to speake Such was my Processe
And of the Canibals that each others eate
The Antropophague and men whose heads
Grew beneath their shoulders These things to heare
Would Desdemona seriously incline
But still the house Affaires would draw her hence
Which euer as she could with haste dispatch
Sheld come againe and with a greedie eare
Deuoure vp my discourse Which I obseruing
Tooke once a pliant houre and found good meanes
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate
Whereof by parcels she had something heard
But not instinctiuely I did consent
And often did beguile her of her teares
When I did speake of some distressefull stroke
That my youth sufferd My Storie being done
She gaue me for my paines a world of kisses
She swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange
Twas pittifull twas wondrous pittifull
She wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd
That Heauen had made her such a man She thankd me
And bad me if I had a Friend that loud her
I should but teach him how to tell my Story
And that would wooe her Vpon this hint I spake
She loud me for the dangers I had past
And I loud her that she did pitty them
This onely is the witchcraft I haue vsd
Here comes the Ladie Let her witnesse it

Enter Desdemona Iago Attendants

  Duke I thinke this tale would win my Daughter too
Good Brabantio take vp this mangled matter at the best
Men do their broken Weapons rather vse
Then their bare hands

   Bra I pray you heare her speake
If she confesse that she was halfe the wooer
Destruction on my head if my bad blame
Light on the man Come hither gentle Mistris
Do you perceiue in all this Noble Companie
Where most you owe obedience
  Des My Noble Father
I do perceiue heere a diuided dutie
To you I am bound for life and education
My life and education both do learne me
How to respect you You are the Lord of duty
I am hitherto your Daughter But heeres my Husband
And so much dutie as my Mother shewd
To you preferring you before her Father
So much I challenge that I may professe
Due to the Moore my Lord

   Bra God be with you I haue done
Please it your Grace on to the State Affaires
I had rather to adopt a Child then get it
Come hither Moore
I here do giue thee that with all my heart
Which but thou hast already with all my heart
I would keepe from thee For your sake Iewell
I am glad at soule I haue no other Child
For thy escape would teach me Tirranie
To hang clogges on them I haue done my Lord

   Duke Let me speake like your selfe
And lay a Sentence
Which as a grise or step may helpe these Louers
When remedies are past the griefes are ended
By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
To mourne a Mischeefe that is past and gon
Is the next way to draw new mischiefe on
What cannot be preserud when Fortune takes
Patience her Iniury a mockry makes
The robd that smiles steales something from the Thiefe
He robs himselfe that spends a bootelesse griefe

   Bra So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile
We loose it not so long as we can smile
He beares the Sentence well that nothing beares
But the free comfort which from thence he heares
But he beares both the Sentence and the sorrow
That to pay griefe must of poore Patience borrow
These Sentences to Sugar or to Gall
Being strong on both sides are Equiuocall
But words are words I neuer yet did heare
That the bruized heart was piercd through the eares
I humbly beseech you proceed to th Affaires of State

   Duke The Turke with a most mighty Preparation
makes for Cyprus Othello the Fortitude of the place is
best knowne to you And though we haue there a Substitute
of most allowed sufficiencie yet opinion a more
soueraigne Mistris of Effects throwes a more safer
voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber
the glosse of your new Fortunes with this more stubborne
and boystrous expedition

   Othe The Tirant Custome most Graue Senators
Hath made the flinty and Steele Coach of Warre
My thricedriuen bed of Downe I do agnize
A Naturall and prompt Alacratie
I finde in hardnesse and do vndertake
This present Warres against the Ottamites
Most humbly therefore bending to your State
I craue fit disposition for my Wife
Due reference of Place and Exhibition
With such Accomodation and besort
As leuels with her breeding

   Duke Why at her Fathers
  Bra I will not haue it so

   Othe Nor I

   Des Nor would I there recide
To put my Father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye Most Gracious Duke
To my vnfolding lend your prosperous eare
And let me finde a Charter in your voice
T assist my simplenesse

   Duke What would you Desdemona
  Des That I loue the Moore to liue with him
My downeright violence and storme of Fortunes
May trumpet to the world My hearts subdud
Euen to the very quality of my Lord
I saw Othellos visage in his mind
And to his Honours and his valiant parts
Did I my soule and Fortunes consecrate
So that deere Lords if I be left behind
A Moth of Peace and he go to the Warre
The Rites for why I loue him are bereft me
And I a heauie interim shall support
By his deere absence Let me go with him

   Othe Let her haue your voice
Vouch with me Heauen I therefore beg it not
To please the pallate of my Appetite
Nor to comply with heat the yong affects
In my defunct and proper satisfaction
But to be free and bounteous to her minde
And Heauen defend your good soules that you thinke
I will your serious and great businesse scant
When she is with me No when light wingd Toyes
Of featherd Cupid seele with wanton dulnesse
My speculatiue and officd Instrument
That my Disports corrupt and taint my businesse
Let Housewiues make a Skillet of my Helme
And all indigne and base aduersities
Make head against my Estimation

   Duke Be it as you shall priuately determine
Either for her stay or going th Affaire cries hast
And speed must answer it

   Sen You must away to night

Othello leaue some Officer behind
And he shall our Commission bring to you
And such things else of qualitie and respect
As doth import you

   Othe So please your Grace my Ancient
A man he is of honesty and trust
To his conueyance I assigne my wife
With what else needfull your good Grace shall think
To be sent after me

Enter

  Rod Iago

   Iago What saist thou Noble heart
  Rod What will I do thinkst thou
  Iago Why go to bed and sleepe

   Rod I will incontinently drowne my selfe

   Iago If thou dost I shall neuer loue thee after Why
thou silly Gentleman
  Rod It is sillynesse to liue when to liue is torment
and then haue we a prescription to dye when death is
our Physition

   Iago Oh villanous I haue lookd vpon the world
for foure times seuen yeares and since I could distinguish
betwixt a Benefit and an Iniurie I neuer found man that
knew how to loue himselfe Ere I would say I would
drowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen I would
change my Humanity with a Baboone

   Rod What should I do I confesse it is my shame
to be so fond but it is not in my vertue to amend it

   Iago Vertue A figge tis in our selues that we are
thus or thus Our Bodies are our Gardens to the which
our Wills are Gardiners So that if we will plant Nettels
or sowe Lettice Set Hisope and weede vp Time
Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes or distract it with
many either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse or manured
with Industry why the power and Corrigeable authoritie
of this lies in our Wills If the braine of our liues
had not one Scale of Reason to poize another of Sensualitie
the blood and basenesse of our Natures would
conduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions But we
haue Reason to coole our raging Motions our carnall
Stings or vnbitted Lusts whereof I take this that you
call Loue to be a Sect or Seyen

   Rod It cannot be

   Iago It is meerly a Lust of the blood and a permission
of the will Come be a man drowne thy selfe Drown
Cats and blind Puppies I haue profest me thy Friend
and I confesse me knit to thy deseruing with Cables of
perdurable toughnesse I could neuer better steed thee
then now Put Money in thy purse follow thou the
Warres defeate thy fauour with an vsurpd Beard I say
put Money in thy purse It cannot be long that Desdemona
should continue her loue to the Moore Put Money in
thy purse nor he his to her It was a violent Commencement
in her and thou shalt see an answerable Sequestration
put but Money in thy purse These Moores
are changeable in their wils fill thy purse with Money
The Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts
shalbe to him shortly as bitter as Coloquintida She
must change for youth when she is sated with his body
she will find the errors of her choice Therefore put Money
in thy purse If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe do
it a more delicate way then drowning Make all the Money
thou canst If Sanctimonie and a fraile vow betwixt
an erring Barbarian and supersubtle Venetian be
not too hard for my wits and all the Tribe of hell thou
shalt enioy her therefore make Money a pox of drowning
thy selfe it is cleane out of the way Seeke thou rather
to be hangd in Compassing thy ioy then to be
drownd and go without her

   Rodo Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on
the issue
  Iago Thou art sure of me Go make Money I haue
told thee often and I retell thee againe and againe I
hate the Moore My cause is hearted thine hath no lesse
reason Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge against
him If thou canst Cuckold him thou dost thy selfe a
pleasure me a sport There are many Euents in the
Wombe of Time which wilbe deliuered Trauerse go
prouide thy Money We will haue more of this to morrow
Adieu

   Rod Where shall we meete ith morning
  Iago At my Lodging

   Rod Ile be with thee betimes

   Iago Go too farewell Do you heare Rodorigo
  Rod Ile sell all my Land
Enter

  Iago Thus do I euer make my Foole my purse
For I mine owne gaind knowledge should prophane
If I would time expend with such Snipe
But for my Sport and Profit I hate the Moore
And it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets
She has done my Office I know not ift be true
But I for meere suspition in that kinde
Will do as if for Surety He holds me well
The better shall my purpose worke on him
Cassios a proper man Let me see now
To get his Place and to plume vp my will
In double Knauery How How Lets see
After some time to abuse Othellos eares
That he is too familiar with his wife
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
To be suspected framd to make women false
The Moore is of a free and open Nature
That thinkes men honest that but seeme to be so
And will as tenderly be lead byth Nose
As Asses are
I haut it is engendred Hell and Night
Must bring this monstrous Birth to the worlds light

Beds

   Iago Nay it is true or else I am a Turke
You rise to play and go to bed to worke
Aemil You shall not write my praise

   Iago No let me not

   Desde What wouldst write of me if thou shouldst
praise me
  Iago Oh gentle Lady do not put me toot
For I am nothing if not Criticall

   Des Come on assay
Theres one gone to the Harbour
  Iago I Madam

   Des I am not merry but I do beguile
The thing I am by seeming otherwise
Come how wouldst thou praise me
  Iago I am about it but indeed my inuention comes
from my pate as Birdlyme dos from Freeze it pluckes
out Braines and all But my Muse labours and thus she
is deliuerd
If she be faire and wise fairenesse and wit
The ones for vse the other vseth it

   Des Well praisd
How if she be Blacke and Witty
  Iago If she be blacke and thereto haue a wit
Shele find a white that shall her blacknesse fit

   Des Worse and worse
Aemil How if Faire and Foolish
  Iago She neuer yet was foolish that was faire
For euen her folly helpt her to an heire

   Desde These are old fond Paradoxes to make Fooles
laugh ith Alehouse What miserable praise hast thou
for her thats Foule and Foolish

   Iago Theres none so foule and foolish thereunto
But dos foule pranks which faire and wiseones do

   Desde Oh heauy ignorance thou praisest the worst
best But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deseruing
woman indeed One that in the authorithy of her
merit did iustly put on the vouch of very malice it
selfe

   Iago She that was euer faire and neuer proud
Had Tongue at will and yet was neuer loud
Neuer lackt Gold and yet went neuer gay
Fled from her wish and yet said now I may
She that being angred her reuenge being nie
Bad her wrong stay and her displeasure flie
She that in wisedome neuer was so fraile
To change the Codshead for the Salmons taile
She that could thinke and neur disclose her mind
See Suitors following and not looke behind
She was a wight if euer such wightes were
  Des To do what
  Iago To suckle Fooles and chronicle small Beere

   Desde Oh most lame and impotent conclusion Do
not learne of him aemillia though he be thy husband
How say you Cassio is he not a most prophane and liberall
Counsailor
  Cassio He speakes home Madam you may rellish
him more in the Souldier then in the Scholler

   Iago He takes her by the palme I well said whisper
With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great
a Fly as Cassio I smile vpon her do I will giue thee
in thine owne Courtship You say true tis so indeed
If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantrie
it had beene better you had not kissd your three fingers
so oft which now againe you are most apt to play
the Sir in Very good well kissd and excellent Curtsie
tis so indeed Yet againe your fingers to your
lippes Would they were Clusterpipes for your
sake
The Moore I know his Trumpet

   Cassio Tis truely so

   Des Lets meete him and recieue him

   Cassio Loe where he comes
Enter Othello and Attendants

  Oth O my faire Warriour

   Des My deere Othello

   Othe It giues me wonder great as my content
To see you heere before me
Oh my Soules Ioy
If after euery Tempest come such Calmes
May the windes blow till they haue wakend death
And let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas
Olympus high and duck againe as low
As hells from Heauen If it were now to dye
Twere now to be most happy For I feare
My Soule hath her content so absolute
That not another comfort like to this
Succeedes in vnknowne Fate

   Des The Heauens forbid
But that our Loues
And Comforts should encrease
Euen as our dayes do grow

   Othe Amen to that sweet Powers
I cannot speake enough of this content
It stoppes me heere it is too much of ioy
And this and this the greatest discords be
That ere our hearts shall make

   Iago Oh you are well tund now But Ile set downe
the peggs that make this Musicke as honest as I am

   Othe Come let vs to the Castle
Newes Friends our Warres are done
The Turkes are drownd
How dos my old Acquaintance of this Isle
Hony you shall be well desird in Cyprus
I haue found great loue amongst them Oh my Sweet
I prattle out of fashion and I doate
In mine owne comforts I prythee good Iago
Go to the Bay and disimbarke my Coffers
Bring thou the Master to the Cittadell
He is a good one and his worthynesse
Dos challenge much respect Come Desdemona
Once more well met at Cyprus

Exit Othello and Desdemona

  Iago Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour
Come thither if thou best Valiant as they say base men
being in Loue haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures
more then is natiue to them listme the Lieutenant to
night watches on the Court of Guard First I must tell
thee this Desdemona is directly in loue with him

   Rod With him Why tis not possible

   Iago Lay thy finger thus and let thy soule be instructed
Marke me with what violence she first loud
the Moore but for bragging and telling her fantasticall
lies To loue him still for prating let not thy discreet
heart thinke it Her eye must be fed And what delight
shall she haue to looke on the diuell When the Blood
is made dull with the Act of Sport there should be a
game to enflame it and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite
Louelinesse in fauour simpathy in yeares Manners
and Beauties all which the Moore is defectiue in Now
for want of these requird Conueniences her delicate
tendernesse wil finde it selfe abusd begin to heaue the
gorge disrellish and abhorre the Moore very Nature wil
instruct her in it and compell her to some second choice
Now Sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and vnforcd
position who stands so eminent in the degree of
this Fortune as Cassio dos a knaue very voluble no
further conscionable then in putting on the meere forme
of Ciuill and Humaine seeming for the better compasse
of his salt and most hidden loose Affection Why none
why none A slipper and subtle knaue a finder of occasion
that hes an eye can stampe and counterfeit Aduantages
though true Aduantage neuer present it selfe
A diuelish knaue besides the knaue is handsome young
and hath all those requisites in him that folly and greene
mindes looke after A pestilent compleat knaue and the
woman hath found him already

   Rodo I cannot beleeue that in her shes full of most
blessd condition

   Iago Blessd figgesend The Wine she drinkes is
made of grapes If shee had beene blessd shee would
neuer haue loud the Moore Blessd pudding Didst thou
not see her paddle with the palme of his hand Didst not
marke that
  Rod Yes that I did but that was but curtesie

   Iago  Leacherie by this hand an Index and obscure
prologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts
They met so neere with their lippes that their breathes
embracd together Villanous thoughts Rodorigo when
these mutabilities so marshall the way hard at hand
comes the Master and maine exercise th incorporate
conclusion Pish But Sir be you ruld by me I haue
brought you from Venice Watch you to night for
the Command Ile layt vpon you Cassio knowes you
not Ile not be farre from you Do you finde some occasion
to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or
tainting his discipline or from what other course
you please which the time shall more fauorably minister

   Rod Well

   Iago Sir hes rash and very sodaine in Choller and
happely may strike at you prouoke him that he may for
euen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny
Whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe
but by the displanting of Cassio So shall you
haue a shorter iourney to your desires by the meanes I
shall then haue to preferre them And the impediment
most profitably remoued without the which there were
no expectation of our prosperitie

   Rodo I will do this if you can bring it to any opportunity

   Iago I warrant thee Meete me by and by at the
Cittadell I must fetch his Necessaries a Shore Farewell

   Rodo Adieu
Enter

  Iago That Cassio loues her I do well beleeut
That she loues him tis apt and of great Credite
The Moore howbeit that I endure him not
Is of a constant louing Noble Nature
And I dare thinke hele proue to Desdemona
A most deere husband Now I do loue her too
Not out of absolute Lust though peraduenture
I stand accomptant for as great a sin
But partely led to dyet my Reuenge
For that I do suspect the lustie Moore
Hath leapd into my Seate The thought whereof
Doth like a poysonous Minerall gnaw my Inwardes
And nothing can or shall content my Soule
Till I am eeuend with him wife for wife
Or fayling so yet that I put the Moore
At least into a Ielouzie so strong
That iudgement cannot cure Which thing to do
If this poore Trash of Venice whom I trace
For his quicke hunting stand the putting on
Ile haue our Michael Cassio on the hip
Abuse him to the Moore in the right garbe
For I feare Cassio with my NightCape too
Make the Moore thanke me loue me and reward me
For making him egregiously an Asse
And practising vpon his peace and quiet
Euen to madnesse Tis heere but yet confusd
Knaueries plaine face is neuer seene till vsd

   Cassio Is your Englishmen so exquisite in his drinking
  Iago Why he drinkes you with facillitie your Dane

Tis Pride that pulls the Country downe
And take thy awld Cloake about thee
Some Wine hoa

Hes a Souldier fit to stand by Caesar
And giue direction And do but see his vice
Tis to his vertue a iust Equinox
The one as long as th other Tis pittie of him
I feare the trust Othello puts him in
On some odde time of his infirmitie
Will shake this Island

   Mont But is he often thus
  Iago Tis euermore his prologue to his sleepe
Hele watch the Horologe a double Set
If Drinke rocke not his Cradle

   Mont It were well
The Generall were put in mind of it
Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature
Prizes the vertue that appeares in Cassio
And lookes not on his euills is not this true
Enter Rodorigo

  Iago How now Rodorigo
I pray you after the Lieutenant go

   Mon And tis great pitty that the Noble Moore
Should hazard such a Place as his owne Second
With one of an ingraft Infirmitie

To the Moore

   Iago Not I for this faire Island
I do loue Cassio well and would do much
To cure him of this euill But hearke what noise

Haue you forgot all place of sense and dutie
Hold The Generall speaks to you hold for shame

   Oth Why how now hoa From whence ariseth this
Are we turnd Turkes and to our selues do that
Which Heauen hath forbid the Ottamittes
For Christian shame put by this barbarous Brawle
He that stirs next to carue for his owne rage
Holds his soule light He dies vpon his Motion
Silence that dreadfull Bell it frights the Isle
From her propriety What is the matter Masters
Honest Iago that lookes dead with greeuing
Speake who began this On thy loue I charge thee
  Iago I do not know Friends all but now euen now
In Quarter and in termes like Bride and Groome
Deuesting them for Bed and then but now
As if some Planet had vnwitted men
Swords out and tilting one at others breastes
In opposition bloody I cannot speake
Any begining to this peeuish oddes
And would in Action glorious I had lost
Those legges that brought me to a part of it

   Othe How comes it Michaell you are thus forgot
  Cas I pray you pardon me I cannot speake

   Othe Worthy Montano you were wont to be ciuill
The grauitie and stillnesse of your youth
The world hath noted And your name is great
In mouthes of wisest Censure Whats the matter
That you vnlace your reputation thus
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a nightbrawler Giue me answer to it

   Mon Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger
Your Officer Iago can informe you
While I spare speech which something now offends me
Of all that I do know nor know I ought
By me thats said or done amisse this night
Vnlesse selfecharitie be sometimes a vice
And to defend our selues it be a sinne
When violence assailes vs

   Othe Now by Heauen
My blood begins my safer Guides to rule
And passion hauing my best iudgement collied
Assaies to leade the way If I once stir
Or do but lift this Arme the best of you
Shall sinke in my rebuke Giue me to know
How this foule Rout began Who set it on
And he that is approud in this offence
Though he had twinnd with me both at a birth
Shall loose me What in a Towne of warre
Yet wilde the peoples hearts brimfull of feare
To Manage priuate and domesticke Quarrell
In night and on the Court and Guard of safetie
Tis monstrous Iago who begant
  Mon If partially Affind or league in office
Thou dost deliuer more or lesse then Truth
Thou art no Souldier

   Iago Touch me not so neere
I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth
Then it should do offence to Michaell Cassio
Yet I perswade my selfe to speake the truth
Shall nothing wrong him This it is Generall
Montano and my selfe being in speech
There comes a Fellow crying out for helpe
And Cassio following him with determind Sword
To execute vpon him Sir this Gentleman
Steppes in to Cassio and entreats his pause
My selfe the crying Fellow did pursue
Least by his clamour as it so fell out
The Towne might fall in fright He swift of foote
Outran my purpose and I returnd then rather
For that I heard the clinke and fall of Swords
And Cassio high in oath Which till to night
I nere might say before When I came backe
For this was briefe I found them close together
At blow and thrust euen as againe they were
When you your selfe did part them
More of this matter cannot I report
But Men are Men The best sometimes forget
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him
As men in rage strike those that wish them best
Yet surely Cassio I beleeue receiud
From him that fled some strange Indignitie
Which patience could not passe

   Othe I know Iago
Thy honestie and loue doth mince this matter
Making it light to Cassio Cassio I loue thee
But neuer more be Officer of mine
Enter Desdemona attended

Looke if my gentle Loue be not raisd vp
Ile make thee an example

   Des What is the matter Deere
  Othe Alls well Sweeting
Come away to bed Sir for your hurts
My selfe will be your Surgeon Lead him off
Iago looke with care about the Towne
And silence those whom this vild brawle distracted
Come Desdemona tis the Soldiers life
To haue their Balmy slumbers wakd with strife
Enter

  Iago What are you hurt Lieutenant
  Cas I past all Surgery

   Iago Marry Heauen forbid

   Cas Reputation Reputation Reputation Oh I haue
lost my Reputation I haue lost the immortall part of
myselfe and what remaines is bestiall My Reputation
Iago my Reputation

   Iago As I am an honest man I had thought you had
receiued some bodily wound there is more sence in that
then in Reputation Reputation is an idle and most false
imposition oft got without merit and lost without deseruing
You haue lost no Reputation at all vnlesse you
repute your selfe such a looser What man there are
more wayes to recouer the Generall againe You are
but now cast in his moode a punishment more in policie
then in malice euen so as one would beate his offencelesse
dogge to affright an Imperious Lyon Sue to
him againe and hes yours

   Cas I will rather sue to be despisd then to deceiue
so good a Commander with so slight so drunken and so
indiscreet an Officer Drunke And speake Parrat And
squabble Swagger Sweare And discourse Fustian
with ones owne shadow Oh thou invisible spirit of
Wine if thou hast no name to be knowne by let vs call
thee Diuell

   Iago What was he that you followd with your
Sword What had he done to you
  Cas I know not

   Iago Ist possible
  Cas I remember a masse of things but nothing distinctly
a Quarrell but nothing wherefore Oh that
men should put an Enemie in their mouthes to steale away
their Braines that we should with ioy pleasance
reuell and applause transforme our selues into Beasts

   Iago Why But you are now well enough how
came you thus recouered
  Cas It hath pleasd the diuell drunkennesse to giue
place to the diuell wrath one vnperfectnesse shewes me
another to make me frankly despise my selfe

   Iago Come you are too seuere a Moraller As the
Time the Place  the Condition of this Country stands
I could hartily wish this had not befalne but since it is as
it is mend it for your owne good

   Cas I will aske him for my Place againe he shall tell
me I am a drunkard had I as many mouthes as Hydra
such an answer would stop them all To be now a sensible
man by and by a Foole and presently a Beast Oh
strange Euery inordinate cup is vnblessd and the Ingredient
is a diuell

   Iago Come come good wine is a good familiar
Creature if it be well vsd exclaime no more against it
And good Lieutenant I thinke you thinke I loue
you

   Cassio I haue well approued it Sir I drunke
  Iago You or any man liuing may be drunke at a
time man I tell you what you shall do Our Generals
Wife is now the Generall I may say so in this respect
for that he hath deuoted and giuen vp himselfe to the
Contemplation marke and deuotement of her parts
and Graces Confesse your selfe freely to her Importune
her helpe to put you in your place againe She is
of so free so kinde so apt so blessed a disposition
she holds it a vice in her goodnesse not to do more
then she is requested This broken ioynt betweene
you and her husband entreat her to splinter And my
Fortunes against any lay worth naming this cracke of
your Loue shall grow stronger then it was before

   Cassio You aduise me well

   Iago I protest in the sinceritie of Loue and honest
kindnesse

   Cassio I thinke it freely and betimes in the morning
I will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake
for me I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me

   Iago You are in the right good night Lieutenant I
must to the Watch

   Cassio Good night honest Iago

Exit Cassio

  Iago And whats he then
That saies I play the Villaine
When this aduise is free I giue and honest
Proball to thinking and indeed the course
To win the Moore againe
For tis most easie
Th inclyning Desdemona to subdue
In any honest Suite Shes framd as fruitefull
As the free Elements And then for her
To win the Moore were to renownce his Baptisme
All Seales and Simbols of redeemed sin
His Soule is so enfetterd to her Loue
That she may make vnmake do what she list
Euen as her Appetite shall play the God
With his weake Function How am I then a Villaine
To Counsell Cassio to this paralell course
Directly to his good Diuinitie of hell
When diuels will the blackest sinnes put on
They do suggest at first with heauenly shewes
As I do now For whiles this honest Foole
Plies Desdemona to repaire his Fortune
And she for him pleades strongly to the Moore
Ile powre this pestilence into his eare
That she repeales him for her bodies Lust
And by how much she striues to do him good
She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore
So will I turne her vertue into pitch
And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net
That shall enmash them all
How now Rodorigo
Enter Rodorigo

  Rodorigo I do follow heere in the Chace not
like a Hound that hunts but one that filles vp the
Crie My Money is almost spent I haue bin to night
exceedingly well Cudgelld And I thinke the issue
will bee I shall haue so much experience for my paines
And so with no money at all and a little more Wit returne
againe to Venice

   Iago How poore are they that haue not Patience
What wound did euer heale but by degrees
Thou knowst we worke by Wit and not by Witchcraft
And Wit depends on dilatory time
Dost not go well Cassio hath beaten thee
And thou by that small hurt hath casheerd Cassio
Though other things grow faire against the Sun
Yet Fruites that blossome first will first be ripe
Content thy selfe awhile Introth tis Morning
Pleasure and Action make the houres seeme short
Retire thee go where thou art Billited
Away I say thou shalt know more heereafter
Nay get thee gone

Exit Roderigo

And great Affinitie and that in wholsome Wisedome
He might not but refuse you But he protests he loues you
And needs no other Suitor but his likings
To bring you in againe

   Cassio Yet I beseech you
If you thinke fit or that it may be done
Giue me aduantage of some breefe Discourse
With Desdemon alone

You haue knowne him long and be you well assurd
He shall in strangenesse stand no farther off
Then in a politique distance

That policie may either last so long
Or feede vpon such nice and waterish diet
Or breede it selfe so out of Circumstances
That I being absent and my place supplyd
My Generall will forget my Loue and Seruice

   Des Do not doubt that before aemilia here
I giue thee warrant of thy place Assure thee
If I do vow a friendship Ile performe it
To the last Article My Lord shall neuer rest
Ile watch him tame and talke him out of patience

With Cassios suite Therefore be merry Cassio

Exit Cassio

  Iago Hah I like not that

   Othel What dost thou say
  Iago Nothing my Lord or if I know not what

   Othel Was not that Cassio parted from my wife
  Iago Cassio my Lord No sure I cannot thinke it
That he would steale away so guiltylike
Seeing your comming

   Oth I do beleeue twas he

   Des How now my Lord
I haue bin talking with a Suitor heere
A man that languishes in your displeasure

   Oth Who ist you meane
  Des Why your Lieutenant Cassio Good my Lord
If I haue any grace or power to moue you
His present reconciliation take
For if he be not one that truly loues you
That erres in Ignorance and not in Cunning
I haue no iudgement in an honest face
I prythee call him backe

   Oth Went he hence now
  Des I sooth so humbled
That he hath left part of his greefe with mee
To suffer with him Good Loue call him backe

   Othel Not now sweet Desdemon some other time

   Des But shallt be shortly
  Oth The sooner Sweet for you

   Des Shallt be to night at Supper
  Oth No not to night

   Des To morrow Dinner then
  Oth I shall not dine at home
I meete the Captaines at the Cittadell

   Des Why then to morrow night on Tuesday morne
On Tuesday noone or night on Wensday Morne
I prythee name the time but let it not
Exceed three dayes Infaith hees penitent
And yet his Trespasse in our common reason
Saue that they say the warres must make example
Out of her best is not almost a fault
T encurre a priuate checke When shall he come
Tell me Othello I wonder in my Soule
What you would aske me that I should deny
Or stand so mamring on What Michael Cassio
That came a woing with you and so many a time
When I haue spoke of you dispraisingly
Hath tane your part to haue so much to do
To bring him in Trust me I could do much

   Oth Prythee no more Let him come when he will
I will deny thee nothing

   Des Why this is not a Boone
Tis as I should entreate you weare your Gloues
Or feede on nourishing dishes or keepe you warme
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your owne person Nay when I haue a suite
Wherein I meane to touch your Loue indeed
It shall be full of poize and difficult waight
And fearefull to be granted

   Oth I will deny thee nothing
Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this
To leaue me but a little to my selfe

   Des Shall I deny you No farewell my Lord

   Oth Farewell my Desdemona Ile come to thee strait

   Des aemilia come be as your Fancies teach you
What ere you be I am obedient
Enter

  Oth Excellent wretch Perdition catch my Soule
But I do loue thee and when I loue thee not
Chaos is come againe

   Iago My Noble Lord

   Oth What dost thou say Iago
  Iago Did Michael Cassio
When he wood my Lady know of your loue
  Oth He did from first to last
Why dost thou aske
  Iago But for a satisfaction of my Thought
No further harme

   Oth Why of thy thought Iago
  Iago I did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir

   Oth O yes and went betweene vs very oft

   Iago Indeed
  Oth Indeed I indeed Discernst thou ought in that
Is he not honest
  Iago Honest my Lord
  Oth Honest I Honest

   Iago My Lord for ought I know

   Oth What dost thou thinke
  Iago Thinke my Lord
  Oth Thinke my Lord Alas thou ecchost me
As if there were some Monster in thy thought
Too hideous to be shewne Thou dost mean somthing
I heard thee say euen now thou likst not that
When Cassio left my wife What diddst not like
And when I told thee he was of my Counsaile
Of my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeede
And diddst contract and purse thy brow together
As if thou then haddst shut vp in thy Braine
Some horrible Conceite If thou dost loue me
Shew me thy thought

   Iago My Lord you know I loue you

   Oth I thinke thou dost
And for I know thourt full of Loue and Honestie
And weighst thy words before thou giust them breath
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
For such things in a false disloyall Knaue
Are trickes of Custome but in a man thats iust
Theyre close dilations working from the heart
That Passion cannot rule

   Iago For Michael Cassio
I dare be sworne I thinke that he is honest

   Oth I thinke so too

   Iago Men should be what they seeme
Or those that be not would they might seeme none

   Oth Certaine men should be what they seeme

   Iago Why then I thinke Cassios an honest man

   Oth Nay yet theres more in this
I prythee speake to me as to thy thinkings
As thou dost ruminate and giue thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words

   Iago Good my Lord pardon me
Though I am bound to euery Acte of dutie
I am not bound to that All Slaues are free
Vtter my Thoughts Why say they are vild and falce
As wheres that Palace whereinto foule things
Sometimes intrude not Who has that breast so pure
Wherein vncleanly Apprehensions
Keepe Leetes and Lawdayes and in Sessions sit
With meditations lawfull
  Oth Thou dost conspire against thy Friend Iago
If thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his eare
A stranger to thy Thoughts

   Iago I do beseech you
Though I perchance am vicious in my guesse
As I confesse it is my Natures plague
To spy into Abuses and of my iealousie
Shapes faults that are not that your wisedome
From one that so imperfectly conceits
Would take no notice nor build your selfe a trouble
Out of his scattering and vnsure obseruance
It were not for your quiet nor your good
Nor for my Manhood Honesty and Wisedome
To let you know my thoughts

   Oth What dost thou meane
  Iago Good name in Man  woman deere my Lord
Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules
Who steales my purse steales trash
Tis something nothing
Twas mine tis his and has bin slaue to thousands
But he that filches from me my good Name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poore indeed

   Oth Ile know thy Thoughts

   Iago You cannot if my heart were in your hand
Nor shall not whilst tis in my custodie

   Oth Ha
  Iago Oh beware my Lord of iealousie
It is the greeneeyd Monster which doth mocke
The meate it feeds on That Cuckold liues in blisse
Who certaine of his Fate loues not his wronger
But oh what damned minutes tels he ore
Who dotes yet doubts Suspects yet soundly loues
  Oth O miserie

   Iago Poore and Content is rich and rich enough
But Riches finelesse is as poore as Winter
To him that euer feares he shall be poore
Good Heauen the Soules of all my Tribe defend
From Iealousie

   Oth Why why is this
Thinkst thou Ild make a Life of Iealousie
To follow still the changes of the Moone
With fresh suspitions No to be once in doubt
Is to be resolud Exchange me for a Goat
When I shall turne the businesse of my Soule
To such exufflicate and blowd Surmises
Matching thy inference Tis not to make me Iealious
To say my wife is faire feeds well loues company
Is free of Speech Sings Playes and Dances
Where Vertue is these are more vertuous
Nor from mine owne weake merites will I draw
The smallest feare or doubt of her reuolt
For she had eyes and chose me No Iago
Ile see before I doubt when I doubt proue
And on the proofe there is no more but this
Away at once with Loue or Iealousie

   Ia I am glad of this For now I shall haue reason
To shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you
With franker spirit Therefore as I am bound
Receiue it from me I speake not yet of proofe
Looke to your wife obserue her well with Cassio
Weare your eyes thus not Iealious nor Secure
I would not haue your free and Noble Nature
Out of selfeBounty be abusd Looke toot
I know our Country disposition well
In Venice they do let Heauen see the prankes
They dare not shew their Husbands
Their best Conscience
Is not to leauet vndone but kept vnknowne

   Oth Dost thou say so
  Iago She did deceiue her Father marrying you
And when she seemd to shake and feare your lookes
She loud them most

   Oth And so she did

   Iago Why go too then
Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming
To seele her Fathers eyes vp close as Oake
He thought twas Witchcraft
But I am much too blame
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much louing you

   Oth I am bound to thee for euer

   Iago I see this hath a little dashd your Spirits
  Oth Not a iot not a iot

   Iago Trust me I feare it has
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from your Loue
But I do see yare mooud
I am to pray you not to straine my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Then to Suspition

   Oth I will not

   Iago Should you do so my Lord
My speech should fall into such vilde successe
Which my Thoughts aymd not
Cassios my worthy Friend
My Lord I see yare moud

   Oth No not much moud
I do not thinke but Desdemonas honest

   Iago Long liue she so
And long liue you to thinke so

   Oth And yet how Nature erring from it selfe

   Iago I theres the point
As to be bold with you
Not to affect many proposed Matches
Of her owne Clime Complexion and Degree
Whereto we see in all things Nature tends
Foh one may smel in such a will most ranke
Foule disproportions Thoughts vnnaturall
But pardon me I do not in position
Distinctly speake of her though I may feare
Her will recoyling to her better iudgement
May fal to match you with her Country formes
And happily repent

   Oth Farewell farewell
If more thou dost perceiue let me know more
Set on thy wife to obserue
Leaue me Iago

   Iago My Lord I take my leaue

   Othel Why did I marry
This honest Creature doubtlesse
Sees and knowes more much more then he vnfolds

   Iago My Lord I would I might intreat your Honor
To scan this thing no farther Leaue it to time
Although tis fit that Cassio haue his Place
For sure he filles it vp with great Ability
Yet if you please to him off awhile
You shall by that perceiue him and his meanes
Note if your Lady straine his Entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunitie
Much will be seene in that In the meane time
Let me be thought too busie in my feares
As worthy cause I haue to feare I am
And hold her free I do beseech your Honor

   Oth Feare not my gouernment

   Iago I once more take my leaue
Enter

  Oth This Fellows of exceeding honesty
And knowes all Quantities with a learnd Spirit
Of humane dealings If I do proue her Haggard
Though that her Iesses were my deere heartstrings
Ild whistle her off and let her downe the winde
To prey at Fortune Haply for I am blacke
And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation
That Chamberers haue Or for I am declind
Into the vale of yeares yet thats not much
Shees gone I am abusd and my releefe
Must be to loath her Oh Curse of Marriage
That we can call these delicate Creatures ours
And not their Appetites I had rather be a Toad
And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon
Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue
For others vses Yet tis the plague to Greatones
Prerogatiud are they lesse then the Base
Tis destiny vnshunnable like death
Euen then this forked plague is Fated to vs
When we do quicken Looke where she comes
Enter Desdemona and aemilia

If she be false Heauen mockd it selfe
Ile not beleeuet

   Des How now my deere Othello
Your dinner and the generous Islanders
By you inuited do attend your presence

   Oth I am too blame

   Des Why do you speake so faintly
Are you not well
  Oth I haue a paine vpon my Forehead heere

   Des Why thats with watching twill away againe
Let me but binde it hard within this houre
It will be well

   Oth Your Napkin is too little
Let it alone Come Ile go in with you
Enter

  Des I am very sorry that you are not well
Aemil I am glad I haue found this Napkin
This was her first remembrance from the Moore
My wayward Husband hath a hundred times
Wood me to steale it But she so loues the Token
For he coniurd her she should euer keepe it
That she reserues it euermore about her
To kisse and talke too Ile haue the worke tane out
And giut Iago what he will do with it
Heauen knowes not I
I nothing but to please his Fantasie
Enter Iago

  Iago How now What do you heere alone
Aemil Do not you chide I haue a thing for you

   Iago You haue a thing for me
It is a common thing
Aemil Hah
  Iago To haue a foolish wife
Aemil Oh is that all What will you giue me now
For that same Handkerchiefe

   Iago What Handkerchiefe
Aemil What Handkerchiefe
Why that the Moore first gaue to Desdemona
That which so often you did bid me steale

   Iago Hast stolne it from her
Aemil No but she let it drop by negligence
And to th aduantage I being heere tookt vp
Looke heere tis

   Iago A good wench giue it me
Aemil What will you do witht that you haue bene
so earnest to haue me filch it
  Iago Why what is that to you
Aemil If it be not for some purpose of import
Giut me againe Poore Lady sheel run mad
When she shall lacke it

   Iago Be not acknowne ont
I haue vse for it Go leaue me

Exit aemil

I will in Cassios Lodging loose this Napkin
And let him finde it Trifles light as ayre
Are to the iealious confirmations strong
As proofes of holy Writ This may do something
The Moore already changes with my poyson
Dangerous conceites are in their Natures poysons
Which at the first are scarse found to distaste
But with a little acte vpon the blood
Burne like the Mines of Sulphure I did say so
Enter Othello

Looke where he comes Not Poppy nor Mandragora
Nor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world
Shall euer medicine thee to that sweete sleepe
Which thou owdst yesterday

   Oth Ha ha false to mee
  Iago Why how now Generall No more of that

   Oth Auant be gone Thou hast set me on the Racke
I sweare tis better to be much abusd
Then but to knowt a little

   Iago How now my Lord
  Oth What sense had I in her stolne houres of Lust
I sawt not thought it not it harmd not me
I slept the next night well fed well was free and merrie
I found not Cassios kisses on her Lippes
He that is robbd not wanting what is stolne
Let him not knowt and hes not robbd at all

   Iago I am sorry to heare this
  Oth I had beene happy if the generall Campe
Pyoners and all had tasted her sweet Body
So I had nothing knowne Oh now for euer
Farewell the Tranquill minde farewell Content
Farewell the plumed Troopes and the bigge Warres
That makes Ambition Vertue Oh farewell
Farewell the neighing Steed and the shrill Trumpe
The Spiritstirring Drum th Earepiercing Fife
The Royall Banner and all Qualitie
Pride Pompe and Circumstance of glorious Warre
And O you mortall Engines whose rude throates
Th immortall Ioues dread Clamours counterfet
Farewell Othellos Occupations gone

   Iago Ist possible my Lord
  Oth Villaine be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore
Be sure of it Giue me the Occular proofe
Or by the worth of mine eternall Soule
Thou hadst bin better haue bin borne a Dog
Then answer my wakd wrath

   Iago Ist come to this
  Oth Make me to seet or at the least so proue it
That the probation beare no Hindge nor Loope
To hang a doubt on Or woe vpon thy life

   Iago My Noble Lord

   Oth If thou dost slander her and torture me
Neuer pray more Abandon all remorse
On Horrors head Horrors accumulate
Do deeds to make Heauen weepe all Earth amazd
For nothing canst thou to damnation adde
Greater then that

   Iago O Grace O Heauen forgiue me
Are you a Man Haue you a Soule or Sense
God buy you take mine Office Oh wretched Foole
That loust to make thine Honesty a Vice
Oh monstrous world Take note take note O World
To be direct and honest is not safe
I thanke you for this profit and from hence
Ile loue no Friend sith Loue breeds such offence

   Oth Nay stay thou shouldst be honest

   Iago I should be wise for Honesties a Foole
And looses that it workes for

   Oth By the World
I thinke my Wife be honest and thinke she is not
I thinke that thou art iust and thinke thou art not
Ile haue some proofe My name that was as fresh
As Dians Visage is now begrimd and blacke
As mine owne face If there be Cords or Kniues
Poyson or Fire or suffocating streames
Ile not indure it Would I were satisfied

   Iago I see you are eaten vp with Passion
I do repent me that I put it to you
You would be satisfied
  Oth Would Nay and I will

   Iago And may but how How satisfied my Lord
Would you the supervision grossely gape on
Behold her topd
  Oth Death and damnation Oh
  Iago It were a tedious difficulty I thinke
To bring them to that Prospect Damne them then
If euer mortall eyes do see them boulster
More then their owne What then How then
What shall I say Wheres Satisfaction
It is impossible you should see this
Were they as prime as Goates as hot as Monkeyes
As salt as Wolues in pride and Fooles as grosse
As Ignorance made drunke But yet I say
If imputation and strong circumstances
Which leade directly to the doore of Truth
Will giue you satisfaction you might hauet

   Oth Giue me a liuing reason shes disloyall

   Iago I do not like the Office
But sith I am entred in this cause so farre
Prickd toot by foolish Honesty and Loue
I will go on I lay with Cassio lately
And being troubled with a raging tooth
I could not sleepe There are a kinde of men
So loose of Soule that in their sleepes will mutter
Their Affayres one of this kinde is Cassio
In sleepe I heard him say sweet Desdemona
Let vs be wary let vs hide our Loues
And then Sir would he gripe and wring my hand
Cry oh sweet Creature then kisse me hard
As if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes
That grew vpon my lippes laid his Leg ore my Thigh
And sigh and kisse and then cry cursed Fate
That gaue thee to the Moore

   Oth O monstrous monstrous
  Iago Nay this was but his Dreame

   Oth But this denoted a foregone conclusion
Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a Dreame

   Iago And this may helpe to thicken other proofes
That do demonstrate thinly

   Oth Ile teare her all to peeces

   Iago Nay yet be wise yet we see nothing done
She may be honest yet Tell me but this
Haue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe
Spotted with Strawberries in your wiues hand
  Oth I gaue her such a one twas my first gift

   Iago I know not that but such a Handkerchiefe
I am sure it was your wiues did I to day
See Cassio wipe his Beard with

   Oth If it be that

   Iago If it be that or any it was here
It speakes against her with the other proofes

   Othel O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues
One is too poore too weake for my reuenge
Now do I see tis true Looke heere Iago
All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen Tis gone
Arise blacke vengeance from the hollow hell
Yeeld vp O Loue thy Crowne and hearted Throne
To tyrannous Hate Swell bosome with thy fraught
For tis of Aspickes tongues

   Iago Yet be content

   Oth Oh blood blood blood

   Iago Patience I say your minde may change

   Oth Neuer Iago Like to the Ponticke Sea
Whose Icie Current and compulsiue course
Neur keepes retyring ebbe but keepes due on
To the Proponticke and the Hellespont
Euen so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
Shall neur looke backe neur ebbe to humble Loue
Till that a capeable and wide Reuenge
Swallow them vp Now by yond Marble Heauen
In the due reuerence of a Sacred vow
I heere engage my words

   Iago Do not rise yet

   Des It hath felt no age nor knowne no sorrow

   Oth This argues fruitfulnesse and liberall heart
Hot hot and moyst This hand of yours requires
A sequester from Liberty Fasting and Prayer
Much Castigation Exercise deuout
For heeres a yong and sweating Diuell heere
That commonly rebels Tis a good hand
A franke one

   Des You may indeed say so
For twas that hand that gaue away my heart

   Oth A liberall hand The hearts of old gaue hands
But our new Heraldry is hands not hearts

   Oth That which I gaue you

   Des I haue it not about me

   Oth Not
  Des No indeed my Lord

   Oth Thats a fault That Handkerchiefe
Did an aegyptian to my Mother giue
She was a Charmer and could almost read
The thoughts of people She told her while she kept it
T would make her Amiable and subdue my Father
Intirely to her loue But if she lost it
Or made a Guift of it my Fathers eye
Should hold her loathed and his Spirits should hunt
After new Fancies She dying gaue it me
And bid me when my Fate would haue me Wiud
To giue it her I did so and take heede ont
Make it a Darling like your precious eye
To looset or giuet away were such perdition
As nothing else could match

   Des Ist possible
  Oth Tis true Theres Magicke in the web of it
A Sybill that had numbred in the world
The Sun to course two hundred compasses
In her Prophetticke furie sowd the Worke
The Wormes were hallowed that did breede the Silke
And it was dyde in Mummey which the Skilfull
Conserud of Maidens hearts

   Des Indeed Ist true
  Oth Most veritable therefore looke toot well

   Des Then would to Heauen that I had neuer seenet
  Oth Ha wherefore
  Des Why do you speake so startingly and rash
  Oth Ist lost Ist gon Speak ist out oth way
  Des Blesse vs

  Des It is not lost but what and if it were
  Oth How
  Des I say it is not lost

   Oth Fetcht let me seet

   Des Why so I can but I will not now
This is a tricke to put me from my suite
Pray you let Cassio be receiud againe

My minde misgiues

   Des Come come youl neuer meete a more sufficient
man

Exit Othello

Aemil Is not this man iealious
  Des I neur saw this before
Sure theres some wonder in this Handkerchiefe
I am most vnhappy in the losse of it

They eate vs hungerly and when they are full
They belch vs
Enter Iago and Cassio

   Des How now good Cassio whats the newes with
you
  Cassio Madam my former suite I do beseech you
That by your vertuous meanes I may againe
Exist and be a member of his loue
Whom I with all the Office of my heart
Intirely honour I would not be delayd
If my offence be of such mortall kinde
That nor my Seruice past nor present Sorrowes
Nor purposd merit in futurity
Can ransome me into his loue againe
But to know so must be my benefit
So shall I cloath me in a forcd content
And shut my selfe vp in some other course
To Fortunes Almes

   Des Alas thricegentle Cassio
My Aduocation is not now in Tune
My Lord is not my Lord nor should I know him
Were he in Fauour as in Humour alterd
So helpe me euery spirit sanctified
As I haue spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blanke of his displeasure
For my free speech You must awhile be patient
What I can do I will and more I will
Then for my selfe I dare Let that suffice you

   Iago Is my Lord angry
Aemil He went hence but now
And certainly in strange vnquietnesse

   Iago Can he be angry I haue seen the Cannon
When it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre
And like the Diuell from his very Arme
Pufft his owne Brother And is he angry
Something of moment then I will go meet him
Theres matter int indeed if he be angry

Exit

  Des I prythee do so Something sure of State
Either from Venice or some vnhatchd practise
Made demonstrable heere in Cyprus to him
Hath pudled his cleare Spirit and in such cases
Mens Natures wrangle with inferiour things
Though great ones are their obiect Tis euen so
For let our finger ake and it endues
Our other healthfull members euen to a sense
Of paine Nay we must thinke men are not Gods
Nor of them looke for such obseruancie
As fits the Bridall Beshrew me much aemilia
I was vnhandsome Warrior as I am
Arraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule
But now I finde I had subornd the Witnesse
And hes Indited falsely
Aemil Pray heauen it bee
State matters as you thinke and no Conception
Nor no Iealious Toy concerning you

   Des Alas the day I neuer gaue him cause
Aemil But Iealious soules will not be answerd so
They are not euer iealious for the cause
But iealious for theyre iealious It is a Monster
Begot vpon it selfe borne on it selfe

   Des Heauen keepe the Monster from Othellos mind
Aemil Lady Amen

   Des I will go seeke him Cassio walke heere about
If I doe finde him fit Ile moue your suite

From the excesse of Laughter Heere he comes

To try me with Affliction had they raind
All kind of Sores and Shames on my barehead

Giuen to Captiuitie me and my vtmost hopes
I should haue found in some place of my Soule
A drop of patience But alas to make me
The fixed Figure for the time of Scorne
To point his slow and mouing finger at
Yet could I beare that too well very well
But there where I haue garnerd vp my heart
Where either I must liue or beare no life
The Fountaine from the which my currant runnes
Or else dries vp to be discarded thence
Or keepe it as a Cesterne for foule Toades
To knot and gender in Turne thy complexion there
Patience thou young and Roselipd Cherubin

  Othe Was this faire Paper This most goodly Booke
Made to write Whore vpon What commited

Did I but speake thy deedes What commited
Heauen stoppes the Nose at it and the Moone winks
The baudy winde that kisses all it meetes
Is hushd within the hollow Myne of Earth
And will not heart What commited

That euen his stubbornesse his checks his frownes
Prythee vnpin me haue grace and fauour

If I do die before prythee shrowd me
In one of these same Sheetes
Aemil Come come you talke

   Des My Mother had a Maid calld Barbarie
She was in loue and he she loud proud mad
And did forsake her She had a Song of Willough
An old thing twas but it expressd her Fortune
And she dyd singing it That Song to night
Will not go from my mind I haue much to do
But to go hang my head all at one side
And sing it like poore Barbarie prythee dispatch

   Aemi Shall I go fetch your Nightgowne
  Des No vnpin me here
This Lodouico is a proper man
Aemil A very handsome man

   Des He speakes well
Aemil I know a Lady in Venice would haue walkd
barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip

   Des The poore Soule sat singing by a Sicamour tree
Sing all a greene Willough
Her hand on her bosome her head on her knee
Sing Willough Willough Willough
The fresh Streames ran by her and murmurd her moanes
Sing Willough c
Her salt teares fell from her and softned the stones
Sing Willough c Lay by these
Willough Willough Prythee high thee hele come anon
Sing all a greene Willough must be my Garland
Let no body blame him his scorne I approue
Nay thats not next Harke who ist that knocks
Aemil Its the wind

   Des I calld my Loue false Loue but what said he then
Sing Willough c
If I court mo women youle couch with mo men
So get thee gone good night mine eyes do itch
Doth that boade weeping
Aemil Tis neyther heere nor there

   Des I haue heard it said so O these Men these men
Dost thou in conscience thinke tell me aemilia
That there be women do abuse their husbands

Aemil Introth I thinke I should and vndoot when
I had done Marry I would not doe such a thing for a
ioynt Ring nor for measures of Lawne nor for Gownes
Petticoats nor Caps nor any petty exhibition But for
all the whole world why who would not make her husband
a Cuckold to make him a Monarch I should venture
Purgatory fort

   Des Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world
Aemil Why the wrong is but a wrong ith world
and hauing the world for your labour tis a wrong in
your owne world and you might quickly make it right

   Des I do not thinke there is any such woman
Aemil Yes a dozen and as many toth vantage as
would store the world they plaid for
But I do thinke it is their Husbands faults
If Wiues do fall Say that they slacke their duties
And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps
Or else breake out in peeuish Iealousies
Throwing restraint vpon vs Or say they strike vs
Or scant our former hauing in despight
Why we haue galles and though we haue some Grace
Yet haue we some Reuenge Let Husbands know
Their wiues haue sense like them They see and smell
And haue their Palats both for sweet and sowre
As Husbands haue What is it that they do
When they change vs for others Is it Sport
I thinke it is and doth Affection breed it
I thinke it doth Ist Frailty that thus erres
It is so too And haue not we Affections
Desires for Sport and Frailty as men haue
Then let them vse vs well else let them know
The illes we do their illes instruct vs so

   Des Good night good night
Heauen me such vses send
Not to picke bad from bad but by bad mend

Which wrought to his desire

Braue me vpon the Watch whereon it came

After long seeming dead Iago hurt him
Iago set him on

   Lod You must forsake this roome and go with vs
Your Power and your Command is taken off
And Cassio rules in Cyprus For this Slaue
If there be any cunning Crueltie
That can torment him much and hold him long

Till that the Nature of your fault be knowne
To the Venetian State Come bring away

When you shall these vnluckie deeds relate
Speake of me as I am Nothing extenuate
Nor set downe ought in malice
Then must you speake
Of one that loud not wisely but too well
Of one not easily Iealious but being wrought
Perplexed in the extreame Of one whose hand
Like the base Iudean threw a Pearle away
Richer then all his Tribe Of one whose subdud Eyes
Albeit vnvsed to the melting moode
Drops teares as fast as the Arabian Trees
Their Medicinable gumme Set you downe this
And say besides that in Aleppo once
Where a malignant and a TurbondTurke
Beate a Venetian and traducd the State
I tooke by th throat the circumcised Dogge
And smoate him thus

   Oth I kist thee ere I killd thee No way but this
Killing my selfe to dye vpon a kisse

  Cas This did I feare but thought he had no weapon
For he was great of heart

More fell then Anguish Hunger or the Sea
Looke on the Tragicke Loading of this bed
This is thy worke
The Obiect poysons Sight
Let it be hid Gratiano keepe the house
And seize vpon the Fortunes of the Moore
For they succeede on you To you Lord Gouernor
Remaines the Censure of this hellish villaine
The Time the Place the Torture oh inforce it
My selfe will straight aboord and to the State
This heauie Act with heauie heart relate
